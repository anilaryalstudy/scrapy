    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>As a student on the BA (Hons) Anthropology degree, your learning will be supported by formal teaching sessions, such as lectures and smaller-group teaching in seminars and practical classes.</p>
<p>Our curriculum places a strong emphasis on inquiry-based learning, with a particular focus on carrying out field-based research. At the start of your second year, you will visit one of our residential field schools to carry out project work, and put your emerging qualitative and quantitative research skills into practice.</p>
<p>The Anthropology Department has anthropometric equipment, a skeletal collection, a fossil cast collection, a material culture collection and other practical resources that are used in relevant modules, and you may also be able to use these independently, to supplement your learning or for project work.</p>
<p>As you move through your BA (Hons) Anthropology degree, you will shift from being a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. To help develop this independence, you will spend part of your time engaged in self-directed study, which will include reading, project work and preparation for classes. In your third year, you will undertake a dissertation on an anthropological topic of your choice, giving you the opportunity to engage in a major piece of independent work.</p>
<p>Assessment on the BA (Hons) Anthropology degree varies by module, but may include written examinations, coursework in the form of essays or research projects, and presentations.</p>
<p>You will be given a Year Group Tutor when you start your degree, and will normally keep the same tutor for the duration of your studies. Year Group Tutors are there to support your academic work by providing advice about such things as study skills, module choices, dissertation topics, and applications for further study or employment. As well as discussing your academic work with your nominated tutor, you are encouraged to make use of the Feedback and Consultation hours provided by academic staff during term-time. These Feedback and Consultation hours give you the opportunity to discuss your work with module tutors, for example, to seek clarification on complex ideas, get suggestions for additional readings, and receive further feedback on assessments.</p>
<p>As a student in the Anthropology Department, you will be welcomed into the wider Departmental community and can attend an extensive programme of research-focused Departmental and research group seminars where academic staff, postgraduate students and visiting scholars present their cutting-edge research, which may provide inspiration for your dissertation topic and even future study or employment.</p>

<p>All of these are supported by a state-of-the-art virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (duo). Seminars, tutorials, and practical classes are much smaller groups than lectures, with tutorials often involving no more than eight students working with a professor or lecturer; seminars and practicals can be larger but are still small enough to allow one-on-one interaction with tutors.</p>
<p>Practicals also allow hands-on experience of the work professional archaeologists perform. The same is true of fieldwork, which at Durham is fully funded, and consists of engaging in archaeological work in the field with members of academic staff.</p>
<p>This emphasis on small-group and practical teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of your learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions. In fact, the degree is designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year.</p>

The course consists of four core modules to provide a solid education in a broad range of Advanced Mechanical Engineering technologies. A choice of one from two optional modules allows you to choose a study course most suited to your interests and needs. The modules include lecture courses, a group design project and an individual research and development project.</p>
<p>You will select one of two optional modules. These modules typically include 38 hours of lectures in addition to coursework and laboratory experiments, allowing you to develop research skills in parallel with lectures. The modules are designed to increase your understanding of either fluid dynamics and thermodynamics or applied mechanics.  You are advised to select the module which you feel would best support your learning needs.</p>
<p>The core lecture modules typically involve 38 hours of lectures and cover topics such as computational stress analysis, fluid mechanics and turbomachinery design. </p>
<p>The third core module is a group design project focused on a realistic application of mechanical engineering technology. You will gain experience in teamwork, presentation skills and project management, as well as the technical aspects of engineering design. You also benefit from this opportunity to develop your research skills in preparation for your individual research and development project.</p>
<p>A major individual research and development project completes the core modules. This provides an open-ended challenge to each individual student, in collaboration with a staff supervisor. Regular meetings are held with your supervisor to discuss project progress and planning issues. A mid-term assessment is carried out to ensure the project is on track. At the end of the project, you are required to submit a final report on your work, in the style of a research paper. You are also required to prepare and present a poster to encourage further development of your ability to present your work to staff and peers. An oral examination is held to allow detailed questions to be put to you regarding the technical aspects of your project. You should expect to have up to 15 hours of contact time with your supervisor plus over 500 hours of research work and preparation, supported by the School’s technicians and other research workers, over the course of your research projects</p>

Durham has a longstanding tradition of international excellence in the field of ancient philosophy, with several recent doctoral students having gone on to take up academic positions in the UK and abroad. The course lasts for one year full-time (two years part-time).</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The MA in Ancient Philosophy is principally conceived as a research training course, which aims to build on the skills in independent learning acquired in the course of the student’s first degree and enable them to undertake fully independent research at a higher level. Contact time with tutors for taught modules is typically a total of <strong>5 hours per week</strong> (rising to 7 for someone beginning Latin or ancient Greek at this level), with an emphasis on small group teaching, and a structure that maximises the value of this time, and best encourages and focuses the student’s own independent study and preparation. On average, around <strong>2 hours a week</strong> of other relevant academic contact (research seminars, dissertation supervision) is also available.</p>
<p>At the heart of the course is the Dissertation module, in which students write a 15,000 word dissertation of a research topic of their own devising. Core research training and support for students’ dissertation research is provided through the Dissertation seminars. These are weekly classes which in the first term introduce the range of <strong>research methods</strong> <strong>and resources</strong> available to someone working in the field of Classics, and over the year build the research skills needed for the dissertation. The classes comprise a mixture of lectures, student-led discussions and student presentations, and are tailored to the individual research interests of each cohort. In addition, students are matched with an individual Dissertation supervisor, who will be an expert in their field of interest, and from whom they will receive an additional five hours of individual dissertation supervision over the year.</p>
<p>In addition to the Dissertation, students select <strong>three or four further optional modules</strong> dealing with particular specialised subjects. At least one of these must involve work with a relevant language (ancient or modern), and at least one must deal directly with research on Ancient Philosophy.</p>
<p>We offer tuition in Greek and Latin at all levels, including Beginners classes for those with no previous experience in the subject, and advanced Greek and Latin Text Seminars for those with degree-level knowledge. Other ancient languages on offer at Durham include Akkadian, Hebrew and Aramaic; modern languages include German, French and Italian (there are usually specialised reading skills courses in these languages, designed to meet the needs of postgraduates who wish to use them for research).</p>
<p>All the optional modules offered at Durham are research-led, i.e. they will form part of the current research activity of the tutor taking the module. Numbers for each module are typically very small (often no more than five or six in a class). Typically, classes are two hours long and held fortnightly, and discussion is based on student presentations. (Modules for those beginning ancient Latin or Greek are typically more heavily subscribed, but their classes also meet more often: 3 hours per week.)</p>
<p>In exceptional cases, students with a particular research training need which matches Departmental expertise but is not covered by the taught provision in our or other Departments in any given year may also make a proposal to take an <strong>Independent Research Topic</strong> in place of one taught MA module. For an IRT, students produce an independent piece of research with an individual member of staff (usually a 5,000-word commentary or extended essay), receiving 5h of supervision. (Nb. There can be no overlap between the IRT and the Dissertation, and students must demonstrate on entry that they have the required expertise, and need, for project work in the relevant area).</p>
<p>All staff teaching on the MA are available for consultation by students, and run weekly office hours in addition to formal contact time. The MA Director acts as Academic Adviser to MA students, and is available as an additional point of contact, especially for matters concerning academic progress.</p>
<p>In addition to the formal part of the course, the Department has a very vibrant culture of research seminars and talks. In particular, MA students are strongly encouraged to attend the Department’s two research seminar series. Although not a formal (assessed) part of the MA, engagement with these seminars across a range of subjects is part of students’ development as researchers and ought to be viewed as essential to their course. In addition, MA students are welcome to attend and present at the ‘Junior Work-in-Progress’ seminar series organised by the PhD students in the Department. Finally, our student-run Classics Society regularly organises guest speakers – often very high-profile scholars from outside Durham.</p>

<li>Entrepreneurship</li>
<li>A foreign language.</li>
</ul>,<h2>Year 3</h2>,<p>All of our degrees offer you the option of spending your third year gaining practical experience on a placement. Placement years are a great way to develop your employment marketability and to engage with employers early in their recruitment pipeline. A placement requires a minimum of 40 weeks of work experience and the placement begins in the summer following completion of the second year, and this then becomes the third year of a four-year degree programme. This allows you to really explore and understand your job and to find out if the career or company is for you.</p>,<ul>
<li>You will develop your practical skills, confidence and maturity.</li>
<li>You can focus on a specific career path – many employers recruit graduates from their placement programme.</li>
<li>You will be able to contextualise your studies better, be more mature in your attitude to work.</li>
<li>You may decide to draw on your working experiences and access a more fulfilling dissertation research subject.</li>
<li>You will gain invaluable job search and graduate research skills by engaging in the competitive placement recruitment process.</li>
</ul>,<p>To ensure you are getting the most out of your experience, we support your placement in a number of ways:</p>,<p><strong>First Year Workshops and Bootcamps </strong>to<strong> </strong>help you to develop your Placement Strategy and to identify and develop those skills and competencies that will be critical to ensure you are attractive to potential placement employers. These typically involve Employers, Placement Mentors and representatives from Colleges, Societies and the Volunteering Community in Durham.</p>,<p><strong>Second Year Workshops and Bootcamps </strong>support you through the placement application process and allow you to develop into a supportive student group to travel along the road of gaining a placement together. They enable you to get to know those students who will return with you in the fourth year. Workshops typically involve employers, and former placement students.</p>,<p><strong>The DUBS Placement Programme</strong> includes a series of employer-led events which take place throughout term 1 and 2 and is open to all first year and second year placement students. The skills sessions and networking events allow students to develop essential employability skills as well as providing valuable insight into the recruitment process.</p>,<p><strong>Placement Mentors: </strong>We have a mentorship scheme whereby former placement students share their experiences of the application process and placement with first and second year students and those out on placement. If you become a placement mentor on your return to University you can continue to develop your interpersonal skills and slide back into your University life with another key role which may well develop a new sense of belonging as well as another valuable contribution to your CV.</p>,<p><strong>Placement Tutors: </strong>Whilst you are on placement you are assigned an academic tutor who will visit you, liaise with your employer and ensure you gain the most from your experience.</p>,<p>The Placement Year fees are set annually by the University. For the definitive amount of the Placement Year tuition fee payable please contact our <a href=""mailto:business.placements@durham.ac.uk"">Placement Team</a>.</p>,<p>*The offer of a place on a ‘with Placement Year’ degree does not imply that Durham University Business School guarantees to find the student a placement. The Business School, in association with the University, will assist students in finding and applying for placements, but it is the responsibility of the student to apply for and to obtain a placement (which is subject to approval by the Business School). In the event that a student is unable to obtain a placement, transfer to the equivalent ‘non-placement’ programme is guaranteed provided the student is eligible to transfer on academic grounds. Due to visa requirements, we recommend that international students interested in the Placement Year as part of their degree apply for this programme when making their application to us via UCAS. This will prevent students having to change their visa in situ at University, and avoid the fee of a new visa.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>On this degree, you will learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, workshops, informal but scheduled one-on-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing. All of these are supported by a state of the art virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO).</p>
<p>Seminars and workshops are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow greater one-on-one interaction with teaching staff. Workshops also allow hands-on experience of solving accounting and finance problems. This emphasis on small-group teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions. In fact, the degree is designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as you move from your first to your final year.</p>
<p>Small-group teaching and one-on-one attention from your personal academic advisor (provided at the start) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a dissertation – supported by one-on-one supervision – that makes up a third of final year credits. In this way the degree gives you the opportunity to transform from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life.</p>
<p>These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the degree and continue at key times throughout each year of the programme. You can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars present their cutting-edge research.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The Ancient History BA will give you an average of <strong>8 hours</strong> of timetabled tuition every week. </p>
<p>The aim of the course is to help you become an independent learner and researcher in the field of Ancient History. In order to do this, it progresses from a greater number of contact hours, designed to promote and support your own study, to a greater intensity of contact in more specialised areas as you gain in independence and experience. </p>
<p>The contact time is made up of weekly lectures, delivered by experts who are active in research in the relevant fields, supported by smaller-group seminars or tutorials per module, designed to give you the opportunity to explore the material covered in lectures in more depth, and to receive detailed feedback on formative assignments. </p>
<p><strong>First-year modules</strong> focus on ensuring that you have a bedrock of knowledge and skills across a number of sub-disciplines which you share with all other students in the Department. Two of the core modules, 'Introduction to the Greek World' and 'Monuments and Memory', include seminars with a special emphasis on research skills. </p>
<p>In the <strong>second and third years</strong> topics are increasingly offered from current research interests of lecturers; lecture and seminar/tutorial sizes become smaller with more scope for interaction with staff. </p>
<p>The <strong>final-year dissertation</strong> gives you your richest opportunity to exercise your skills in independent learning and research. You receive support in choosing a topic at the end of your second year; and one-to-one supervisory support with an expert in the field through the writing of your dissertation in your final year. </p>
<p>Every module coordinator is available for consultation about particular issues, and advertises office hours when their presence can be guaranteed. You will be allocated an academic mentor, with who you will discuss your module choices within the context of your interests and aims (academic and personal). Mentors are available for consultation throughout the year. </p>
<p>You are encouraged to attend the Department’s research seminar series, which are scheduled at times when you would be available to attend. In addition, the student-run Classics Society regularly organises guest speakers. </p>
<p>You will also have the opportunity to attend events and workshops focused on your future career, organised in collaboration with alumni of the Department and the Careers and Enterprise Centre.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>If you study the Ancient, Medieval and Modern History BA, you will follow a structured programme of study comprised of modules delivered by the Department of History and the Department of Classics and Ancient History. You will receive, on average, 7 hours of formal contact per week. However, the exact number of contact hours will depend on your selection of modules as you will be given the option to specialise in ancient, medieval, or modern history as you progress.</p>
<p>Formal academic contact will include a combination of lectures, seminars, and tutorials. Lectures introduce broad historical questions and offer contextualisation and critical commentary; seminars provide an opportunity for you to develop your critical skills through discussion for which you would have prepared in advance. The balance between these activities will change as you develop your knowledge and abilities as an independent learner.</p>
<p>Timetabled contact is only the beginning of your learning. It provides a starting point for your development as an independent, self-motivated learner. Resource packages and reading lists will be provided to guide your independent learning.</p>
<p>Typically, during your <strong>first year</strong>, you can expect to receive around 8 hours of formal contact per week. You will study modules that introduce you to a range of perspectives (not just historical) and different forms of evidence, and prepare you for a wide range of more specifically historical modules about politics and society, as well as the study of ancient literature, language, and philosophy, in your second and third years. The modules offer engagement with different periods and approaches to the study of the past, and experience of the way in which History, as a community of practice, encompasses the diversity of the human experience. Two core modules, 'Introduction to the Greek World' and 'Monuments and Memory', include seminars with a special emphasis on research skills.</p>
<p>In your <strong>second year</strong> there is an increased emphasis on the development of critical and analytical skills. As you become more adept at independent research, the intensity of contact in more specialised areas will increase. You can expect to receive around 7 hours of formal contact per week.</p>
<p>In the <strong>third year</strong> you will take further responsibility for managing your own time. The curriculum, while continuing to offer support and guidance, will require you to use the skills in independent study and time management which you have developed in the two preceding years. The dissertation, in particular, gives you the opportunity to establish your own research agenda and identify primary historical sources and extended reading lists, and so to engage, at an advanced level, with creative cutting-edge research at the forefront of the discipline. The exact number of contact hours that you receive will depend upon your module choices and specialisms. You will be expected to spend at least 35 hours each week in independent research. Because of this, you can expect to receive, on average, around 5 hours of formal contact per week.</p>
<p>Throughout the course you will also benefit from the ready accessibility of staff. All module coordinators advertise their formal ‘office hours’ so that you can arrange one-to-one meetings to discuss particular issues. This un-timetabled contact often focuses on a specific issue of analysis or argument and gives students a strong sense of personal engagement with learning. In addition to this, you will be allocated an academic adviser with whom you will discuss your module choices within the context of your interests and aims (academic and personal).</p>
<p>You will be encouraged to attend the extensive programme of research-related activities in both departments, including the research seminar series, public lectures from high-profile guest speakers, and events organised by the student-run History Society and Classics Societies. In addition to this, you will be invited to attend regular events organised jointly by the department and the Careers, Employability, and Enterprise Centre.</p>

Placement years are a great way to develop your employment marketability and to engage with employers early in their recruitment pipeline. A placement requires a minimum of 40 weeks of work experience and the placement begins in the summer following completion of the second year, and this then becomes the third year of a four-year degree. This allows you to really explore and understand your job and to find out if the career or company is for you.</p>,<ul>
<li>You will develop your practical skills, confidence and maturity.</li>
<li>You can focus on a specific career path – many employers recruit graduates from their placement programme.</li>
<li>You will be able to contextualise your studies better, be more mature in your attitude to work.</li>
<li>You may decide to draw on your working experiences and access a more fulfilling dissertation research subject.</li>
<li>You will gain invaluable job search and graduate research skills by engaging in the competitive placement recruitment process.</li>
</ul>,<p>To ensure that you are getting the most out of your experience, we support your placement in a number of ways:</p>,<p><strong>First Year Workshops and Bootcamps </strong>to<strong> </strong>help you to develop your Placement Strategy and to identify and develop those skills and competencies that will be critical to ensure you are attractive to potential placement employers. These typically involve Employers, Placement Mentors and representatives from Colleges, Societies and the Volunteering Community in Durham.</p>,<p><strong>Second Year Workshops and Bootcamps </strong>support you through the placement application process and allow you to develop into a supportive student group to travel along the road of gaining a placement together. They enable you to get to know those students who will return with you in the fourth year. Workshops typically involve employers, and former placement students.</p>,<p><strong>The DUBS Placement Programme</strong> includes a series of employer-led events which take place throughout term 1 and 2 and is open to all first year and second year placement students. The skills sessions and networking events allow you to develop essential employability skills as well as providing valuable insight into the recruitment process.</p>,<p><strong>Placement Mentors: </strong>We have a mentorship scheme whereby former placement students share their experiences of the application process and placement with first and second year students and those out on placement. If you become a placement mentor on your return to University you can continue to develop your interpersonal skills and slide back into your University life with another key role which may well develop a new sense of belonging as well as another valuable contribution to your CV.</p>,<p><strong>Placement Tutors: </strong>Whilst you are on placement you are assigned an academic tutor who will visit you, liaise with your employer and ensure you gain the most from your experience.</p>,<p>The Placement Year fees are set annually by the University. For the definitive amount of the Placement Year tuition fee payable please contact our <a href=""mailto:business.placements@durham.ac.uk"">Placement Team</a>.</p>,<p>*The offer of a place on a ‘with Placement Year’ degree does not imply that Durham University Business School guarantees to find the student a placement. The Business School, in association with the University, will assist students in finding and applying for placements, but it is the responsibility of the student to apply for and to obtain a placement (which is subject to approval by the Business School). In the event that a student is unable to obtain a placement, transfer to the equivalent ‘non-placement’ programme is guaranteed provided the student is eligible to transfer on academic grounds. Due to visa requirements, we recommend that international students interested in the Placement Year as part of their degree apply for this degree when making their application to us via UCAS. This will prevent students having to change their visa in situ at University, and avoid the fee of a new visa.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">

To study visual arts and culture is a way of paying attention to phenomena that are everywhere. The concept of ‘visual culture’ acknowledges the pervasive nature of visual phenomena, and signals openness towards both the breadth of objects and images, and the range of theoretical and methodological perspectives needed to understand them adequately.</p>,<p>Drawing upon research strengths across the departments that contribute to the course, the MA in Visual Culture encourages a broad geographical and chronological scope, while allowing you to engage with a wide range of visual phenomena, including fine art, film, photography, architecture, and scientific and medical imaging practices.</p>,<p>The importance of critical visual literacy in the contemporary world cannot be exaggerated. ‘The illiterate of the future’, wrote the Bauhaus artist and theoretician László Moholy-Nagy, ‘will be the person ignorant of the camera as well as of the pen’. This observation was made in the 1920s, when photography was first used in the periodical press and in political propaganda. The rich visual world of the early twentieth century pales in comparison with the visual saturation that now characterises everyday experience throughout the developed societies and much of the developing world. But the study of visual culture is by no means limited to the twentieth century. Turning our attention to past cultures with a particular eye to the significance of visual objects of all kinds yields new forms of knowledge and understanding.</p>,<p>Our course facilitates the development of critical visual literacy in three main ways. First, it attends to the specificity of visual objects, images and events, encouraging you to develop approaches that are sensitive to the individual works they encounter. Second, it investigates the nature of perception, asking how it is that we make meaning out of that which we see. Finally, it investigates how our relationships with other people, and with things, are bound up in the act of looking.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The MA in Visual Culture is designed to allow you maximum scope to explore and develop your own fields of interest, in line with the courses generous understanding of the visual. The core module is based on interactive, student-centred seminars and skills-development workshops, including object handling. The module is thus fully integrated: research skills and subject knowledge are developed in tandem and in dialogue with each other. In advance of seminars, you will follow a programme of guided reading that will acquaint you with some of the most important approaches to visual culture. The module also includes field trips to major museums and galleries, which will give you the chance to think about the ways in which visual culture is displayed, learn about museums and galleries as a research resource, and meet senior curatorial staff.</p>
<p>In your assessments, you have the opportunity to use the approaches explored in the seminars in order to explore an aspect or aspects of visual culture that particularly appeal to you. You can select a book to review for the critical review exercise, an exhibition to analyse for your fieldwork report, and an object on which to write your object commentary. When it comes to the research essay, the scope is wide: possibilities include but are not limited to: a specific image or artefact, a movement or trend, a body of theory, a particular collection, social uses of the visual, a particular medium, or an individual artist. Supervision is available in an extensive range of subject areas.</p>
<p>The optional modules on the course involve diverse modes of teaching and learning, from lectures and seminars to placement learning.</p>
<p>In the dissertation module, you will be paired with a supervisor and will work independently, with supervisory support, to produce an extended piece of research which, once again, can be closely tailored to your own interests.</p>

Strong emphasis is placed on independent research. In preparation for the MA dissertation, all students submit a 1,000 word research proposal at the beginning of the second term, and are given constructive feedback on it.

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>To be a student on the BA (Hons) in Theology and Religion is to undergo a process of self-discovery, within a supportive and friendly community, made up of fellow students, and staff.</p>
<p>Human beings always have had, and always will have, worldviews, and fundamental beliefs about the way the universe is, and their role in it. And this is the part of the human condition that is studied in a Theology and Religion Department, from a range of methodological and disciplinary perspectives: social scientific/anthropological; textual; historical, and philosophical/ethical. The Theology and Religion Department is a place where ‘belief’ and ‘beliefs’ are taken seriously, respected, and studied, whether those beliefs are atheistic, humanistic, or religious. So, for example, if you are interested in worldviews, including, for example, atheism, Christianity, or humanism, the Department of Theology and Religion is the place for you.</p>
<p>This process of learning and teaching is conducted using a variety of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lectures</li>
<li>Seminars</li>
<li>Tutorials</li>
<li>Study skills classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these activities support, and are supported by, your own independent and scholarly engagement with texts and issues, and the writing of assignments, on which you will receive feedback. Through the process of doing the degree, you will grow as an independent and creative thinker and researcher.</p>
<p>In the <strong>first year</strong> you will receive about 8–9 hours of timetabled contact each week. First year modules are intended to provide the foundational understanding and skills necessary for work in theology and the study of religion. Weekly lectures will introduce you to the broad questions and current issues in the subject area, and will enable you to develop a clear understanding of the subject and to improve your skills in evaluating and analysing information. Seminars (typically six in each of your six modules) will give you the opportunity to engage with the topics introduced in lectures and to discuss key issues in small groups; they also promote awareness of and respect for different viewpoints and approaches, and help you articulate and develop your own views in dialogue with others. You will also be able to get detailed feedback on your essays, to help you improve the quality of your written work.</p>
<p>For each hour of timetabled contact, you will be expected to complete about three hours of independent research. This will enable you to broaden your subject knowledge, prepare for lectures and seminars, and complete written assignments. We will provide you with reading lists, handouts, suggestions for preparation, and other online materials to guide you in your research.</p>
<p>There are also general lectures in the first year on study skills. These provide you with the basics about accessing the library, reading, note taking, essay writing, and the like. But they also set you on the path to becoming an independent learner, helping you to understand how to find out for yourself the resources you will need, and the skills you will have to develop for effective intellectual engagement with texts and issues.</p>
<p>Every member of staff has weekly office hours when they are available to meet with students on a ‘drop-in’ basis. You will also get a personal academic adviser who meets with you a number of times each year, and is responsible for your overall academic progress. He or she is usually the first person you would turn to if you have queries or problems. Academic advisors are also very helpful when it comes to finding someone to write a reference for you!</p>
<p>The <strong>second and third years </strong>develop this approach of research-led learning. There is a much greater choice of modules in the second year, to allow you to pursue your own interests within theology and religion by building on the understanding and abilities you have begun to develop in the first year. There is also an increased emphasis on the development of critical and analytical skills, and on the ability to write more extensive pieces of writing based on your own research. As modules specialise more strongly in particular areas, the type of teaching varies more markedly between modules, and the kind of contact you experience depends to a greater extent on the modules you take. On average, in the second year the number of timetabled contact hours is similar to those in the first year, as are the number of hours you will need to dedicate to your own independent learning.</p>
<p>The culmination of the process of becoming an independent researcher is the third-year dissertation, a large research project that counts for one third of your marks for your final year. This gives you the opportunity to engage at an advanced level with creative cutting-edge research at the forefront of the discipline, working on a topic of your choice, with a specialist within the Department. On account of the time you will need to undertake this research, timetabled contact in the third year is reduced (to an average of just under six hours a week), but this is balanced by six 45-minute tutorials of one-to-one contact with a supervisor dedicated to discussing your own research project, together with a number of classes on dissertation research skills. The dissertation is excellent not only for those students interested in further academic research, but also represents the cumulative development of skills in analysis, synthesis, presentation and interpretation which the degree aims to foster and which are highly prized by future employers.</p>
<p>In addition to all this the Department also has an extensive series of research-related activities which you are warmly encouraged to attend. These include several research seminars and public lectures from high-profile guest speakers and visiting scholars; the University also frequently hosts eminent and well-known visiting speakers. You will also receive invitations to attend regular workshops that are organised by the Department and the Careers and Enterprise Centre.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p class=""tablegrid1"">Most MA teaching is delivered through small group seminars and tutorials. These exemplify and encourage the various skills and practices required for independent scholarly engagement with texts and issues. Teaching in the Department of Theology and Religion is research led and is informed by staff research, but more importantly, it aims to develop you as independent researchers, able to pursue and explore your own research interests and questions. This is why the independently researched MA dissertation is the culmination of the MA course. Such engagement with texts and issues is not only an excellent preparation for doctoral research, but it also develops those skills of critical analysis, synthesis and presentation sought and required by employers. </p>
<p class=""tablegrid1"">Many MA classes will contain a ‘lecture’ element, conveying information and exemplifying an approach to the subject matter that will enable you to develop a clear understanding of the subject and improve your own ability to analyse and evaluate information and arguments. Seminars enhance knowledge and understanding through preparation and interaction with other students and staff, promoting awareness of and respect for different viewpoints and approaches, and developing skills of articulacy, advocacy and interrogation. Through small group discussions and tutorials, feedback is provided on completed work, with the opportunity to discuss specific issues in detail, enhancing knowledge and writing skills.</p>
<p>The dissertation module includes training in generic research skills, from the use of the library to issues in referencing and bibliography. The subject specific core module introduces you to questions of interpretation and argument in the disciplines encompassed by theology and religion helping you to develop your own interests and questions. The latter is a piece of independent research, but it is fostered and guided through individual tutorials with a superviser with who you will meet throughout the academic year.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>ELC MA courses are delivered via lectures, seminars, practical sessions and micro-teaching sessions, giving you a solid grounding in both the theoretical and practical aspects of the field. In many cases, contact hours will be a mixture of these approaches (rather than a session consisting solely of a two-hour lecture). The balance will depend on the particular module, with some more suited to a lecture/seminar approach, others being of a more practical nature.</p>
<p>The focus throughout the courses is on independent learning and student engagement, with you being expected to participate in presentations and micro-teaching. The average weekly number of contact hours over the first two terms is 12, with you filling the remaining time with reading, class preparation and assignments.</p>
<p>In addition, starting in the first term, you will attend a series of dissertation sessions (typically 2 hours per fortnight) culminating in a poster conference in term 3. You will be assigned a dissertation supervisor and can expect 3 or 4 meetings during term 3 and the summer.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The BA (Hons) Sociology is delivered through a mixture of lectures, seminars, research-based workshops, individual supervision of a research-based assignment and guided independent work through learning technologies such as DUO (Durham University Online).</p>
<p>Lectures provide key information on the key conceptual tools, methodologies, research and scholarship in the subject area. They also expose students to the skills of research synthesis and note taking.</p>
<p>Seminars are intended as guided, small group discussions of the subject area. They rely on independent study outside the degree’s formal contact hours to be effective. They provide key learning scaffolding opportunities for the development of skills of conceptualisation and contextualisation, which are key for these courses. You will also develop public speaking skills and research synthesis abilities.</p>
<p>Research-based workshops allow you to develop practical, hands-on experience of research in the subject area in the context of small group discussion and team working. They are also useful for developing collaborative work skills as well as information gathering and analysis skills.</p>
<p>The balance of these learning contexts changes over the course of the degree, as you develop your knowledge and understanding of the subject area and increase your confidence and abilities as independent, autonomous and critical learners. This is crucial not only for your integration into the social science community but also for success in diverse professional and working environments, as well as further study.</p>
<p>In the first year, you will develop foundational knowledge and understanding of key concepts and issues in the field of Sociology. At level one, you are expected to attend an average of six hours of lectures per week, as well as around six hours of small group-based teaching fortnightly, during the first two terms. Outside timetabled contact hours, you are also expected to undertake your own independent study to prepare for your classes and broaden your subject knowledge.   </p>
<p>In the second year, the balance begins to shift, as you enhance your ability as an independent learner. You will engage with more advanced conceptual and theoretical issues as well as a range of skills and knowledge related to research design and practice.  While lectures still play an important role in supporting your understanding and analytical skills, small-group classes and independent work come to the fore, in the form of student-led seminars, research-based workshops and practical classes, and so on.  While on average students have the same volume of contact time compared with the first year, more of that time is spent with students taking the lead and drawing more explicitly on independent preparatory work.</p>
<p>In the final year of study, you will move towards developing expertise in complex conceptualisation and contextualisation of sociological issues through detailed examination of substantive topics in Sociology.  Lectures and small group teaching retain the same typical format as in previous years but you will be invited to engage with academic issues at the forefront of Sociology in a learning environment that is very much focused on student-led discussion and analysis.  As the capstone of the degree, you will also carry out an independent research study for your dissertation project, drawing upon methodological, conceptual and substantive skills and knowledge developed across the whole of the degree.</p>
<p>The final year of study also has a number of unique study opportunities.  The dissertation module provides an opportunity to put into practice research skills you have developed in earlier years. While this project is completed on a largely independent basis, you receive guidance in the form of one-to-one supervision sessions with an academic member of staff in addition to general workshops addressing common themes and issues. Further, through the Inside Out: Issues in Criminal Justice module, you have the opportunity to learn about issues of crime and justice studying alongside local prison inmates.  The Community Placement module also provides an opportunity for you to apply your sociological skills and knowledge in a working environment while acquiring valuable work experience.</p>
<p>Across the degree, assessment is primarily coursework-based with essays, reports, portfolios and so on constituting around 80% of your final grade, depending on exactly what modules you take.</p>
<p>In addition to one-to-one supervision which you receive as part of your dissertation, your year tutor will provide general support and guidance on your studies across the course.  Alongside this, all staff maintain regular office hours during which you are welcome to meet on a drop-in basis and can be seen by appointment at other times.</p>

All students take 3 optional modules, taught in small seminar groups of up to 10, with each module generating 18 hours of contact time (9 seminars x 2 hours) over the academic year. A strong emphasis is placed on independent research, and seminars usually involve a considerable amount of preparation, including short presentations and workshop activities. Assessment for these modules is usually by coursework essay.</p>
<p>All students register for a triple-weighted dissertation, which generates an additional 20 hours of contact time over the first two terms in the form of fortnightly seminars, together with an additional 3.5 hours of dedicated individual supervision time in the third term. Strong emphasis is placed on independent research. In preparation for the MA dissertation, all students submit a 1,000 word research proposal at the beginning of the second term, and are given constructive feedback on it. A draft chapter (approximately 3,500) words will be read and commented upon by their supervisor</p>
<p>Each MA student is assigned an Academic Advisor who can guide and support her or his progress during the programme of study.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>Understanding and managing risk is ultimately about choice. All elements of society, from individuals to governments, must make decisions – conscious or not – about the ways in which they perceive, interpret, balance, and mitigate risk. Risk permeates our day-to-day lives in ways that are now recognised to be much more complex than the hazard-vulnerability paradigm, which dominated risk research until the 1990s, recognised. A deeper understanding of the nature of risk, its emergence, and its interface and position within societies, has emphasised the need to take a much more complex view in which a general understanding of the ways in which risk is generated, experienced and managed needs to be combined with a specific understanding of particular science or policy areas.</p>
<p>The primary aim of this Masters degree is to equip you with a general understanding of risk, whilst simultaneously providing specific training in science-based elements of risk-related research. This will be achieved through an interdisciplinary framework for understanding risk from a variety of perspectives. You will learn theoretical and practical approaches to identifying and framing risk, as well as the underlying physical and social mechanisms that generate it. You will also examine the relationship of risk to knowledge and policy, and be made aware of the array of advanced tools and techniques to assess the physical and social dimensions of risk under conditions of uncertainty. You will also be trained in the substance and methods associated with a range of science and policy areas, and be expected to demonstrate that you can combine your general training in risk with your specific understanding of the substance and method associated with the chosen area, through either a research-based or a vocational dissertation. Through a combination of core and elective modules, the MA offers two unique pathways for the development of practical skills associated to risk analysis:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Environmental Hazards and Resilience</em></strong>: This pathway provides specialised scientific training in environmental hazards that pose large risks to communities living throughout the world — such as earthquakes, flooding events, landslides and many others. Students will receive theoretical and practical training for understanding, quantifying and/or critically evaluating environmental hazards and the relationship of these with issues of vulnerability and resilience. They will learn about how environmental hazards and risks persist over long periods of time instead of merely as single events, and are made up of both natural processes as well as socio-economic dynamics. Its main modules are ‘Spatial and Temporal Dimensions of Hazards’ and  ‘Hydro-meteorological Hazards’.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Climate Risk and Society:</em></strong> A new pathway within the Risk Masters, developed in response to student demand and the need to support our graduates in addressing the most relevant societal challenges of today. It seeks to provide students with an advanced understanding of anthropogenic climate change as an issue that poses new challenges, risks and vulnerabilities to society. It also supports students in developing tools for apprehending, interpreting and responding to the emerging natural and socio-political threats associated to climate change. The <em>Climate Risk and Society</em> pathway provokes students to think critically about how evolving understandings of risk, resilience and vulnerability shape efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The pathway’s main module is ‘Climate Risk and Society’.    </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The Risk Masters (both in its MA and MSc forms) is taught jointly between Durham University’s Geography Department, the School of Government &amp; International Affairs, and the School of Applied Social Sciences. The course’s interdisciplinary approach encourages you to combine science and social science perspectives. You have a broad range of modules to choose from, and in this way develop an individualized set of professional skills that, depending on the student’s preferences, speak more to either the natural sciences (e.g. via scientific modelling, GIS or science and communication) or the social sciences (e.g. via social science research methodologies and engagements with social policy and international relations). The course is delivered in close collaboration with Durham University’s Institute of Hazard, Risk and Resilience (IHRR), and through IHRR’s activities students get permanent exposure to both practitioner and academic perspectives at the forefront of risk thinking and practice.</p>

<p>Human beings always have had, and always will have, worldviews, and fundamental beliefs about the way the universe is, and their role in it. And this is the part of the human condition that is studied in a Theology and Religion Department, from a range of methodological and disciplinary perspectives: social scientific/anthropological; textual; historical, and philosophical/ethical. The Theology and Religion Department is a place where ‘belief’ and ‘beliefs’ are taken seriously, respected, and studied, whether those beliefs are atheistic, humanistic, or religious. So, for example, if you are interested in worldviews, including, for example, atheism, Christianity, or humanism, the Department of Theology and Religion is the place for you.</p>
<p>This process of learning and teaching is conducted using a variety of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lectures</li>
<li>Seminars</li>
<li>Tutorials</li>
<li>Study skills classes.</li>

<p>All of these activities support, and are supported by, your own independent and scholarly engagement with texts and issues, and the writing of assignments, on which you will receive feedback. Through the process of doing the degree, you will grow as an independent and creative thinker and researcher.</p>
<p>In the <strong>first year</strong> you will receive about 8–9 hours of timetabled contact each week. First year modules are intended to provide the foundational understanding and skills necessary for work in theology and the study of religion. Weekly lectures will introduce you to the broad questions and current issues in the subject area, and will enable you to develop a clear understanding of the subject and to improve your skills in evaluating and analysing information. Seminars (typically six in each of your six modules) will give you the opportunity to engage with the topics introduced in lectures and to discuss key issues in small groups; they also promote awareness of and respect for different viewpoints and approaches, and help you articulate and develop your own views in dialogue with others. You will also be able to get detailed feedback on your essays, to help you improve the quality of your written work.</p>
<p>For each hour of timetabled contact, you will be expected to complete about three hours of independent research. This will enable you to broaden your subject knowledge, prepare for lectures and seminars, and complete written assignments. We will provide you with reading lists, handouts, suggestions for preparation, and other online materials to guide you in your research.</p>
<p>There are also four general lectures in the first year on study skills. These provide you with the basics about accessing the library, reading, note-taking, essay writing, and the like. But they also set you on the path to becoming an independent learner, helping you to understand how to find out for yourself the resources you will need and the skills you will have to develop for effective intellectual engagement with texts and issues.</p>
<p>Every member of staff has weekly office hours when they are available to meet with students on a ‘drop-in’ basis. You will also get a personal academic adviser who meets with you a number of times each year, and is responsible for your overall academic progress. He or she is usually the first person you would turn to if you have queries or problems. Academic advisors are also very helpful when it comes to finding someone to write a reference for you!</p>
<p>The <strong>second and third years </strong>develop this approach of research-led learning. There is a much greater choice of modules in the second year, to allow you to pursue your own interests within theology and religion by building on the understanding and abilities you have begun to develop in the first year. There is also an increased emphasis on the development of critical and analytical skills, and on the ability to write more extensive pieces of writing based on your own research. As modules specialise more strongly in particular areas, the type of teaching varies more markedly between modules, and the kind of contact you experience depends to a greater extent on the modules you take. On average in the second year, the number of timetabled contact hours is similar to those in the first year, as are the number of hours you will need to dedicate to your own independent learning.</p>
<p>The culmination of the process of becoming an independent researcher is the third-year dissertation, a large research project that counts for one-third of your marks for your final year. This gives you the opportunity to engage at an advanced level with creative cutting-edge research at the forefront of the discipline, working on a topic of your choice, with a specialist within the Department. On account of the time you will need to undertake this research, timetabled contact in the third year is reduced (to an average of just under six hours a week), but this is balanced by six 45-minute tutorials of one-to-one contact with a supervisor dedicated to discussing your own research project, together with a number of classes on dissertation research skills. The dissertation is excellent not only for those students interested in further academic research, but also represents the cumulative development of skills in analysis, synthesis, presentation and interpretation which the degree aims to foster and which are highly prized by future employers.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, the Department also has an extensive series of research-related activities which you are warmly encouraged to attend. These include several research seminars and public lectures from high-profile guest speakers and visiting scholars; the University also frequently hosts eminent and well-known visiting speakers. You will also receive invitations to attend regular workshops that are organised by the Department and the Careers and Enterprise Centre.</p>

The dedication to our teaching and research consistently puts us high up in all the league tables. While studying here you will benefit from the buzz and creative environment of a large research department and join a dynamic and focused intellectual community. Our research ranges from fundamental elementary particle physics and cosmology to more applied topics in which we collaborate closely with industry.</p>,<p>We offer degrees in Physics, Physics and Astronomy, and Theoretical Physics, all of which are accredited by the Institute of Physics. Our course structures have been designed to provide flexibility in your final choice of degree course. The three-year BSc degree is aimed at those mainly interested in a degree in Physics as a preparation for a career not necessarily in the Physics area.</p>,<p>Our four-year MPhys degrees will suit those looking for professional training leading to research in physics or a physics-related career. The first year of the BSc and MPhys degree courses in Physics, Physics and Astronomy, and Theoretical Physics is identical, and it is possible to select modules in your second year such that you need not make a firm choice of course until the end of the second year.</p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>Foundations of Physics is the main lecture module in the first year and is complemented with a practical laboratory module, including an introduction to programming. Two mathematics modules are taken in the Department of Mathematical Sciences. There is a further module of choice, with Introduction to Astronomy proving to be very popular.</p>,<h2>Year 2</h2>,<h3>Core modules:</h3>,<ul>
<li>Foundations of Physics 2A/2B</li>
<li>Mathematical Methods in Physics</li>
<li>Laboratory Skills and Electronics.</li>
</ul>,<p>Additional topics include Theoretical Physics 2 (the transition from classical to quantum mechanics), Stars and Galaxies (an exploration of astrophysics), and Physics in Society.</p>,<p>At the end of the year, you need to decide your degree title, choosing between:</p>,<ul>

<li>Physics into schools</li>
<li>Maths Workshop</li>
<li>Team Project</li>
<li>Laboratory Project</li>
<li>A module taken in another department (subject to approval).</li>
</ul>,<p>Your options will have an emphasis on theoretical physics.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The degree is mainly delivered through a mixture of lectures, laboratories, tutorials and workshops. The lectures will provide the means to give a concise, focused presentation of the relevant area of Physics. The lecture material will be explicitly linked to the contents of recommended textbooks for the module, thus making clear where students can begin their private study. When appropriate, the lectures will also be supported by the distribution of written material, or by information and relevant links on the University Virtual Learning Environment.</p>
<p>You will be able to obtain further help in your studies by approaching your lecturers, either after lectures or at other mutually convenient times (the Department has a policy of encouraging such enquiries). You will learn how to plan experiments and to interpret data quantitatively and systematically in the laboratory classes. Regular problem exercises will give you the chance to develop your theoretical understanding and problem-solving abilities. These problem exercises will form the basis for discussions in tutorial groups of typically six students in the first year. The tutorials will also provide an informal environment for students to raise issues of interest or difficulty.</p>
<p>The balance of these types of activities changes over the course of the degree, as you develop your knowledge, and your skills as an independent learner.</p>
<p>In the first year, students typically attend 12 hours a week of lectures, one three-hour laboratory session per week, one one-hour Physics tutorial each week and two one-hour Mathematics tutorials. Outside timetabled contact hours, students are also expected to undertake their own independent study to prepare for their classes and broaden their subject knowledge.</p>
<p>A similar balance holds in the second year, although with a change from tutorials to module-specific workshops. In the workshops, typically three supervisors circulate among typically 50 students to provide support. By the end of the second year, students will have covered the vast majority of the material specified in the Institute of Physics ‘Core of Physics’, required for any accredited Physics degree, allowing them considerable flexibility in the choices for the remainder of their degree.</p>
<p>By the third year, students have greatly extended their abilities as independent learners. At this stage also, laboratories are replaced by Mathematics Workshops and additional lectures in Theoretical Physics, resulting in a similar contact time to the previous years.</p>
<p>This move towards greater emphasis on independent learning continues in the final year. Half of their time will be spent on a Research project in one of the (world leading) research groups in the department. Students will meet with a research supervisor for typically an hour per week during term-time, and depending on the project may be working in the department for an additional 12-15 hours per week. These projects are genuine open-ended research which has commonly resulted in material publishable in refereed Physics journals. In addition students will typically spend 6 hours per week in lectures on advanced topics which can be chosen from the various research areas in the Department.</p>
<p>Throughout the degree, all students also have access to an academic adviser who will provide them with academic support and guidance. Typically a student will meet with their adviser three times a year, in addition to which all members of teaching staff are available to meet with students, either on a ‘drop-in’ basis or during regular ‘office hours’. There are also regular seminars run throughout the year by the student-led Physics society and Astronomy society.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p class=""tablegrid1"">Most MA teaching is delivered through small group seminars and tutorials. These exemplify and encourage the various skills and practices required for independent scholarly engagement with texts and issues. Teaching in the Department of Theology and Religion is ‘research led’ at both BA and MA levels, but particularly at MA level. Research led teaching is informed by staff research, but more importantly, it aims to develop you as independent researchers, able to pursue and explore your own research interests and questions. This is why the independently researched MA dissertation is the culmination of the MA course. Such engagement with texts and issues is not only an excellent preparation for doctoral research, it also develops those skills of critical analysis, synthesis and presentation sought and required by employers.</p>
<p class=""tablegrid1"">Many MA classes will contain a ‘lecture’ element, conveying information and exemplifying an approach to the subject matter that will enable you to develop a clear understanding of the subject and improve your own ability to analyse and evaluate information and arguments. Seminars enhance knowledge and understanding through preparation and interaction with other students and staff, promoting awareness of and respect for different viewpoints and approaches, and developing skills of articulacy, advocacy and interrogation. Through small group discussions and tutorials, feedback is provided on completed work, with the opportunity to discuss specific issues in detail, enhancing knowledge and writing skills.</p>
<p>The Dissertation module includes training in generic research skills, from the use of the Library to issues in referencing and bibliography. The subject specific core module introduces you to questions of interpretation and argument in the disciplines encompassed by theology and religion, and helps you to develop your own interests and questions that will issue in the MA dissertation. The latter is a piece of independent research, but it is fostered and guided through individual tutorials with a supervisor, with whom you will meet throughout the academic year.</p>

In general, lectures highlight the main areas of concern within a module topic, covering historical and current empirical findings and methodological issues together with their concomitant theoretical interpretations. Small group seminars guide your learning of lecture-based material and that gleaned through independent study by promoting discussions and critical appraisal, developing your ability to organise and present information both orally and in a variety of written formats. Workshops and practical classes enable you to gain first-hand experience of key research skills in Psychology and Anthropology, and to learn and apply associated statistical and IT packages.</p>
<p>Our curriculum places a strong emphasis on inquiry-based learning, with a particular focus on learning how to carrying out your own research. As you move through your degree, you will shift from being a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. To help develop this independence, you will spend part of your time engaged in self-directed study, which will include reading, project work and preparation for classes. You will also make use of the diverse research facilities on offer across both Departments. In your third year, you will undertake a dissertation on a topic of your choice that integrates psychology and anthropology, giving you the opportunity to engage in a major piece of independent work under the joint supervision of an appropriate psychology and anthropology staff member. The specialist topic modules are provided by lecturers eminent in their field, meaning you will have the unique opportunity to engage with and discuss the most recent theoretical, empirical and applied/societal issues.</p>
<p>Assessment on the BSc (Hons) Psychology &amp; Anthropology degree varies by module, but may include written examinations, coursework in the form of essays, practical reports or research projects, and presentations, posters or articles aimed at the general public.</p>
<p>You will be given a Year Group Tutor when you start your degree, and will normally keep the same tutor for the duration of your studies. Year Group Tutors are there to support your academic work by providing advice about such things as study skills, module choices, dissertation topics, and applications for further study or employment. There is also a termly First Generation Scholars coffee morning to provide additional support on the transition to University. As well as discussing your academic work with your nominated tutor, you are encouraged to make use of the Feedback and Consultation hours provided by academic staff during term-time. These Feedback and Consultation hours give you the opportunity to discuss your work with module tutors, for example, to seek clarification on complex ideas, get suggestions for additional readings, and receive further feedback on assessments.</p>
<p>As a student in the Anthropology and Psychology Departments, you will be welcomed into the wider Departmental communities and can attend an extensive programme of research-focused Departmental and research group seminars where academic staff, postgraduate students and visiting scholars present their cutting-edge research, which may provide inspiration for your dissertation topic and even future study or employment. In addition, there are student-led Psychology and Anthropology Societies that hold talks, meetings and social events.</p>

You will get the chance to study people in terms of their internal mental processes, the biological mechanisms that underlie their behaviour, and the social and developmental context in which they act. The degree provides the opportunity for the development of extensive subject-specific and transferable skills.</p>,<p>You will take modules to the value of 120 credits each year.</p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>In the first year, you will take three core modules in Psychology:</p>,<ul>
<li>Introduction to Psychology 1: Cognitive and Biological Psychology (20 credits)</li>
<li>Introduction to Psychology 2: Developmental and Social Psychology (20 credits)</li>
<li>Introduction to Psychological Research (40 credits).</li>
</ul>,<p>In addition, you will take the following compulsory tutorial-based module:</p>,<ul>
<li>Classic Papers: A Tutorial Introduction to Psychological Science (20 credits).</li>
</ul>,<p>The above compulsory Psychology modules count for 100 of your 120 credits (three single modules, plus the double module), so in addition, you may choose:</p>,<ul>
<li>A module to the value of 20 credits (including modules from other departments and the University’s Centre for Foreign Language Study).</li>
</ul>,<p><em>For modules taken from another University department you must meet their entry requirements and must be able to timetable your additional subjects to fit in with your compulsory modules.</em></p>,<h2>Year 2</h2>,<p>In the second year, you will build upon your first year and complete 120 credits of compulsory Psychology modules:</p>,<ul>
<li>Modules in the core areas of Psychology: Abnormal Psychology, Biological, Cognitive, Developmental, Individual Differences, and, Social Psychology (6 x 10 credits)</li>
<li>A tutorial-based module on Contemporary Issues in Psychology (20 credits)</li>
<li>Research Methods in Psychology (20 credits)</li>
<li>Statistics for Psychology (20 credits).</li>
</ul>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The degree is delivered predominantly by leading research academics using a variety of methods including lectures, small group tutorials, workshops, and practical classes, as well as additional individual feedback and support opportunities from staff and student peers. Psychology and Behavioural Science modules up to the value of 120 credits are taken in each of the three years of study, with each module having clearly defined aims and learning outcomes encompassing subject-specific knowledge, subject-specific skills, and generic transferable key skills.</p>
<p>In general, lectures highlight the main areas of concern within a module topic, covering historical and current empirical findings and methodological issues together with their concomitant theoretical interpretations. Small group tutorials guide your learning of lecture-based material and that gleaned through independent study by promoting discussions and critical appraisal, developing your ability to organise and present information both orally and in a variety of written formats. Workshops and practical sessions enable you to gain first-hand experience of key research skills in Psychology and Behavioural Science, and to learn and apply associated statistical and IT packages.</p>
<p>The number of weekly timetabled contact hours does not vary radically across the three years of the degree. However, there is a qualitative difference in the nature of the activities provided and in staff expectations: you are supported in becoming progressively more independent as thinkers and learners in preparation for further work or study on completion of your degree.</p>
<p>In the first and second years, you will typically attend six hours of research-driven psychology lectures every week; additionally, timetabled tutorials, practical classes, workshops, feedback and support sessions are held regularly throughout the year. These constitute an additional two to three hours contact time per week. Outside timetabled hours, you are expected to undertake independent study to prepare for classes, complete assignments, and broaden your subject knowledge. The emphasis in Year 1 is to provide you with fundamental knowledge and skills as a foundation for those who have had no previous experience of psychology and providing the bases underpinning second and third-year modules. In Year 2, your knowledge and skills are further developed and fostered; moreover, all the subject areas essential for accreditation by the British Psychological Society (BPS) and providing eligibility for Graduate Basis for Chartered Membership (GBC) are covered (note that the BSc (Hons) in Behavioural Science is a new degree and accreditation is currently pending).</p>
<p>In the third year, you will select from a variety of specialist topic modules. As these are primarily provided by lecturers eminent in their field, you will have the unique opportunity to engage with and discuss the most recent theoretical and empirical issues. Year 3 modules are delivered through weekly two-hour lectures, seminars and workshops typically totalling eight hours per week. Additionally, building on research skills developed in their first and second years, and under the supervision of a member of staff, each third-year student completes an independent empirical study. Depending on the nature of the investigation, you might expect to meet with your supervisor on average once a fortnight throughout the year.</p>
<p>Throughout your three undergraduate years, you will have access to all your lecturers informally on a ‘drop-in basis’, by email appointment, or through advertised weekly office hours. All staff are willing to engage in discussions, provide support, feedback and guidance where relevant. There are also Module Leaders who are members of staff designated to deal with issues relating to modules as a whole and Year Tutors who are available to help when necessary with any problems that may generally affect your studies in Psychology.</p>
<p>The Department has a thriving research community: Seminars are held at least once a week during term-time to which undergraduate students are warmly invited. Additionally, research groupings within the Department and the student-run Psychology Society hold talks and meetings.</p>
<p>Further non-timetabled opportunities for support and debate are provided by the Research Assistant Scheme, and by online discussion boards facilitated by the Psychology Department.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>At the beginning of the academic year, you will go through five-day induction events in which you are informed about University, the School, the MA/MSc degrees and the facilities available for their learning.</p>
<p>The 180 credits one-year MA degree is divided into two core and two optional modules of 30 credits each. Furthermore, you will have to submit a dissertation of 60 credits of not more than 12,000 words. Most of the modules are delivered during the first two terms and you will spend the remaining time writing your dissertation.</p>
<p>PGT modules involve a range of different modes of delivery, but are largely based around lectures, seminars and other forms of active learning activities. The School places great importance on research-led teaching, which integrates new and cutting-edge research into the curriculum. Each module is build around 300 hours of learning, a large portion of which is independent reading and preparation. Class contact hours are all above 20 hours per module, with the exception of the dissertation, and are spread across the 12 teaching weeks in the academic calendar.  Typically modules would have elements of lectures, discussions, and presentations or other activities — the extent of each of these components would differ from one module to another.</p>
<p>All modules include a formative assessment to help you prepare for summative assignments by allowing you to identify what aspects of your work you are doing well on and which areas require improvement. You are encouraged to make appointments with the course lecturers to discuss module content, and after you have received it, any feedback on your work.</p>
<p>Typically summative assessments are around 3000 words, but these vary based on learning outcomes, assessment type, and module design. Some modules may be assessed by examination. The majority of coursework involves independent reading and written assignments, but you will have the opportunity to discuss course material as well either through presentations or class discussions.  You will be assigned a dissertation supervisor, who will also act as your academic advisor, and is someone you can consult throughout the year for general academic support, in addition to dissertation supervision.</p>
<p>SGIA conducts regular seminars and organises lectures throughout the year which all postgraduate students can attend. These events provide opportunities to engage with, and debate, the most important issues in current political and international studies.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the programme you can contact the Careers Office of the University to get advice on available job prospects and get assistance on applying for these.</p>

The dedication to our teaching and research consistently puts us high up in all the league tables. While studying here you will benefit from the buzz and creative environment of a large research department and join a dynamic and focused intellectual community. Our research ranges from fundamental elementary particle physics and cosmology to more applied topics in which we collaborate closely with industry.</p>,<p>We offer degrees in Physics, Physics and Astronomy, and Theoretical Physics, all of which are accredited by the Institute of Physics. Our course structures have been designed to provide flexibility in your final choice of degree course. The three-year BSc degree is aimed at those mainly interested in a degree in Physics as a preparation for a career not necessarily in the Physics area.</p>,<p>Our four-year MPhys degrees will suit those looking for professional training leading to research in physics or a physics-related career. The first year of the BSc and MPhys degree courses in Physics, Physics and Astronomy, and Theoretical Physics is identical, and it is possible to select modules in your second year such that you need not make a firm choice of course until the end of the second year. </p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>Foundations of Physics 1 is the main lecture module in the first year and is complemented with a practical laboratory module, including an introduction to programming.

<li>Maths Workshop</li>
<li>Physics into Schools</li>
<li>Team Project</li>
<li>Laboratory Project.</li>
<li>A module taken in another department (subject to approval).</li>
</ul>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The degree is mainly delivered through a mixture of lectures, laboratories, tutorials and workshops. The lectures will provide the means to give a concise, focused presentation of the relevant area of Physics. The lecture material will be explicitly linked to the contents of recommended textbooks for the module, thus making clear where you can begin your private study. When appropriate, the lectures will also be supported by the distribution of written material, or by information and relevant links on the University Virtual Learning Environment. </p>
<p>You will be able to obtain further help in your studies by approaching your lecturers, either after lectures or at other mutually convenient times (the Department has a policy of encouraging such enquiries). You will learn how to plan experiments and to interpret data quantitatively and systematically in the laboratory classes. Regular problem exercises will give you the chance to develop your theoretical understanding and problem-solving abilities. These problem exercises will form the basis for discussions in tutorial groups of typically six students in the first year. The tutorials will also provide an informal environment for you to raise issues of interest or difficulty.</p>
<p>The balance of these types of activities changes over the course of the degree, as you develop your knowledge, and your skills as an independent learner.</p>
<p>In the first year, you will typically attend 12 hours a week of lectures, one three-hour laboratory session per week, one one-hour Physics tutorial each week and two one-hour Mathematics tutorials. Outside timetabled contact hours, you are also expected to undertake your own independent study to prepare for your classes and broaden your subject knowledge.</p>
<p>A similar balance holds in the second year, although with a change from tutorials to module-specific workshops. In the workshops, typically three supervisors circulate among typically 50 students to provide support. By the end of the second year, you will have covered the vast majority of the material specified in the Institute of Physics ‘Core of Physics’, required for any accredited Physics degree, allowing you considerable flexibility in your choices for the remainder of your degree.</p>
<p>By the third year, you will have greatly extended your abilities as an independent learner. Although the contact time breakdown remains similar, there is considerable freedom in the way in which laboratory projects are carried out. There is also a possibility of performing a Team Project – open ended research projects supplied by industrial partners, where you will be reporting back to the partner directly on your results.</p>
<p>This move towards greater emphasis on independent learning continues in the final year. Half of your time will be spent on a Research project in one of the (world-leading) research groups in the Department. You will meet with a research supervisor for typically an hour per week during term-time, and depending on the project (laboratory based or theoretical) may be working in the Department for an additional 12-15 hours per week. These projects are genuine open-ended research which has commonly resulted in material publishable in refereed Physics journals. In addition, you will typically spend six hours per week in lectures on advanced topics which can be chosen from the various research areas in the Department.</p>
<p>Throughout the degree, you will also have access to an academic adviser who will provide you with academic support and guidance. Typically you will meet with your adviser three times a year, in addition to which all members of teaching staff are available to meet with students, either on a ‘drop-in’ basis or during regular ‘office hours’. There are also regular seminars run throughout the year by the student-led Physics society and Astronomy society.</p>

The dedication to our teaching and research consistently puts us high up in all the league tables. While studying here you will benefit from the buzz and creative environment of a large research department and join a dynamic and focused intellectual community. Our research ranges from fundamental elementary particle physics and cosmology to more applied topics in which we collaborate closely with industry.</p>,<p>We offer degrees in Physics, Physics and Astronomy, and Theoretical Physics, all of which are accredited by the Institute of Physics. Our course structures have been designed to provide flexibility in your final choice of degree course. The three-year BSc degree is aimed at those mainly interested in a degree in Physics as a preparation for a career, not necessarily in the Physics area.</p>,<p>Our four-year MPhys degrees will suit those looking for professional training, leading to research in physics or a physics-related career. The first year of the BSc and MPhys degree courses in Physics, Physics and Astronomy, and Theoretical Physics is identical and it is possible to select modules in your second year such that you need not make a firm choice of course until the end of the second year.</p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>Foundations of Physics 1 is the main lecture module in the first year, and is complemented with a practical laboratory module, including an introduction to programming. Two mathematics modules are taken in the Department of Mathematical Sciences. There is a further module of choice, with Introduction to Astronomy proving to be very popular.</p>,<h2>Year 2</h2>,<h3>Core modules:</h3>,<ul>
<li>Foundations of Physics 2A/2B</li>
<li>Mathematical Methods in Physics</li>
<li>Laboratory Skills and Electronics.</li>
</ul>,<p>Additional topics also include Theoretical Physics 2 (the transition from classical to quantum mechanics), Stars and Galaxies (an exploration of astrophysics), and Physics in Society.</p>,<p>At the end of the year, you need to decide your degree title, choosing between:</p>,<ul>
<li>BSc Physics (F300)</li>
<li><a href=""course/F301"">MPhys Physics (F301)</a></li>
<li><a href=""course/FF3N"">MPhys Physics and Astronomy (FF3N)</a></li>
<li><a href=""course/F344"">MPhys Theoretical Physics (F344).</a></li>
</ul>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The course is mainly delivered through a mixture of lectures, laboratories, tutorials and workshops. The lectures will provide the means to give a concise, focused presentation of the relevant area of Physics. The lecture material will be explicitly linked to the contents of recommended textbooks for the module, thus making clear where you can begin your private study. When appropriate, the lectures will also be supported by the distribution of written material, or by information and relevant links on the University Virtual Learning Environment.</p>
<p>You will be able to obtain further help in your studies by approaching your lecturers, either after lectures or at other mutually convenient times (the Department has a policy of encouraging such enquiries). You will learn how to plan experiments and to interpret data quantitatively and systematically in the laboratory classes. Regular problem exercises will give you the chance to develop your theoretical understanding and problem-solving abilities. These problem exercises will form the basis for discussions in tutorial groups of typically six students in the first year. The tutorials will also provide an informal environment for you to raise issues of interest or difficulty.</p>
<p>The balance of these types of activities changes over the course of the degree, as you develop your knowledge, and your skills as an independent learner.</p>
<p>In the first year, you will typically attend 12 hours a week of lectures, one three-hour laboratory session per week, one one-hour physics tutorial each week and two one-hour mathematics tutorials. Outside timetabled contact hours, you are also expected to undertake your own independent study to prepare for your classes and broaden your subject knowledge.</p>
<p>A similar balance holds in the second year, although with a change from tutorials to module-specific workshops. In the workshops, typically three supervisors circulate among typically 50 students to provide support. By the end of the second year, you will have covered the vast majority of the material specified in the Institute of Physics ‘Core of Physics’, required for any accredited Physics degree, allowing you considerable flexibility in your choices for the remainder of your degree.</p>
<p>By the third year, you will have greatly extended your abilities as an independent learner. Although the contact time breakdown remains similar, there is considerable freedom in the way in which laboratory projects are carried out. There is also a possibility of doing a Team Project – open-ended research projects supplied by industrial partners, where you will be reporting back to the partner directly on your results.</p>
<p>Throughout the degree, you will also have access to an academic adviser who will provide you with academic support and guidance. Typically you will meet with your adviser three times a year, in addition, to which, all members of teaching staff are available to meet with students, either on a ‘drop-in’ basis or during regular ‘office hours’. There are also regular seminars run throughout the year by the student-led Physics society and Astronomy society.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>As a student on the BA (Hons) Philosophy and Theology degree, you will receive on average about 8 hours of timetabled contact per week over the course of the year. This will include a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, and study skills classes. The number and balance of these different activities will change over the course of your degree as you develop your knowledge and ability to undertake your own independent and scholarly engagement with texts and issues.</p>
<p>The various methods of teaching exemplify and facilitate the various skills, practices and virtues required for independent scholarly engagement with texts and issues. Lectures present a model of scholarship and articulacy by conveying foundational material and exemplifying an approach to the subject-matter so that you develop a clear understanding of the subject and improve your skills in evaluating and analysing information. Seminars enhance your knowledge and understanding of the subject through preparation and interaction with other students and staff, promoting awareness of and respect for different viewpoints and approaches, and developing your skills of articulacy, advocacy and interrogation.</p>
<p>During one-to-one and small group discussions and tutorials you will receive feedback on your work and you will have the opportunity to discuss specific issues in detail, enhance your knowledge, and further develop your writing skills. From the outset of the degree your philosophical development will be supported by a strong emphasis on dialogical interaction, extended discussion, ample opportunities for questions, and structured, critical dialogue in the context of a friendly, supportive environment.</p>
<p>Timetabled contact is only the beginning of your learning. It provides a starting point for your development as an independent learner. Typically, classroom teaching and learning will form about 25% of the time you will spend on your studies; you will be expected to spend the remaining 75% of your time on independent research. We will provide you with reading lists, handouts, suggestions for preparation, and other online materials to guide you in your independent research.</p>
<p>The culmination of the process of becoming an independent researcher is the third-year dissertation, a large research project that counts for one third of your marks for your final year. This gives you the opportunity to engage at an advanced level with creative cutting-edge research at the forefront of the discipline, working on a topic of your choice. The dissertation is excellent not only for those students interested in further academic research, but also represents the cumulative development of skills in analysis, synthesis, presentation and interpretation which the degree aims to foster and which are highly prized by future employers.</p>
<p>Throughout your studies, you will be invited and encouraged to seek one-to-one feedback on your written work either during formal feedback sessions or during staff ‘office hours’. Each year the Director of Undergraduate Studies contacts all undergraduate students with suggestions about how to get one-to-one feedback on written work. In both departments students are welcome to call by staff members’ offices or make appointments via email whenever needed.</p>
<p>Students on this Joint Honours degree benefit from access to study support and broader academic activities provided by both departments:</p>
<p><strong>Department of Theology and Religion:</strong> In Year 1, connected to the Academic Advising system, there are lectures by departmental staff and staff from the University's Academic Writing Unit on various study skills necessary for successful learning at a research-led University, including effective reading, note-taking, academic writing, and conducting research (including how to access literature from the library). At Year 2, toward the end of the year, there is a lecture on preparation for the level-three dissertation. At Year 3, late in autumn term, the Dissertations Coordinator offers a presentation on various aspects of researching for and writing the dissertation.</p>
<p><strong>Department of Philosophy:</strong> You will be offered three annual workshops, on: (1) essay writing; (2) examination technique; and (3) choosing modules for Years 2 and 3. All students are welcomed as full members of the Department’s intellectual community from the moment they arrive here. They are invited to attend Royal Institute of Philosophy Lectures, Research Seminars, Undergraduate Philosophy Society talks and other department events.</p>
<p>The departments also have extensive programmes of research-related activities which you are warmly encouraged to attend. These include several research seminar series and public lectures from high-profile guest speakers and visiting scholars. The University also frequently hosts eminent and well-known visiting speakers. In addition to this, you will receive invitations to attend regular workshops that are organised in collaboration with the Careers and Enterprise Centre.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>Students on this course learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials (Politics &amp; Philosophy), informal but scheduled one-on-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing.</p>
<p>All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO). Seminars and tutorials are much smaller groups than lectures, with tutorials often involving no more than eight students working with a professor or lecturer; seminars and workshops can be larger but are still small enough to allow one-on-one interaction with tutors; some of these also allow hands-on experience of the kind of work professional political scientists perform.</p>
<p>This emphasis on small-group teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions. In fact, the degree is designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as you move from your first to your final year.</p>
<p>Small-group teaching and one-on-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the course) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a capstone dissertation—supported by one-on-one supervision—that makes up a third of final year credits.</p>
<p>In this way the degree systematically transforms you from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the course and continue at key times throughout each year of the degree.</p>
<p>You can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars present their cutting-edge research.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>Students taking the BA (Hons) in Philosophy will receive an average of eight timetabled contact hours per week over the course of the degree.</p>
<p>Philosophical development is principally a matter of acquiring a range of reasoning skills, rather than familiarising oneself with a body of knowledge. Hence, from the outset, the course places a strong emphasis on dialogical interaction. Lectures involve plenty of opportunities for questions and extended discussion, and tutorials consist mostly of structured, critical dialogue in the context of a friendly, supportive environment.</p>
<p>Timetabled contact is only a part of the learning process, and its aim is to provide you with the knowledge and skills required to navigate the relevant literature yourself and to pursue independent learning. Lectures and accompanying documents contextualise material and introduce you to topics, positions and debates. At least four hours of additional study per week are recommended for each lecture, which includes reading and the completion of assignments. You are therefore expected to spend around 75% of your study time on independent research. Having done your reading, you return to lecture topics in small group tutorials. These help you to refine your understanding of material, and to develop the reasoning skills needed to formulate, present, defend and criticise philosophical positions.</p>
<p>In the <strong>first year</strong> of study, there are nine hours of contact time per week, consisting of weekly lectures and fortnightly tutorials. All our students are welcomed as full members of the Department’s intellectual community from the moment of their arrival, and attend an induction lecture during the first week of the course.</p>
<p>In the <strong>second</strong> and <strong>third years</strong>, as you further develop the critical skills required for independent learning, lecture-based modules are complemented by seminar-based modules. Weekly ninety-minute seminars place more emphasis on student participation, in the form of group exercises and short presentations. Modules also become more specifically focused, and you are offered a wider range of topics to choose from, especially in the third year. These build upon lower level modules in a coherent, progressive fashion. For example, you have the option of pursuing a distinctive ‘history and philosophy of science and medicine’ strand, which runs throughout our curriculum.</p>
<p>Other evolving areas of study include aesthetics, philosophy of mind and psychology, theoretical and applied ethics, logic and metaphysics, history of philosophy, ‘continental’ philosophy, and non-western philosophy. Therefore, you will have the opportunity to steer your studies in a range of different directions, many of which are interdisciplinary. You will do so under the guidance of internationally recognised experts in the relevant fields, who are in a position to familiarise you with cutting-edge research.</p>
<p>In the <strong>second year</strong>, you will continue to receive an average of nine hours of scheduled contact time per week. However, this reduces to six hours in the <strong>third year</strong>, when you write a dissertation, which is a cornerstone of the degree. To help prepare for it, there is a lecture in your second-year, explaining how to go about choosing a dissertation topic and supervisor. In addition, you receive detailed instructions via email. In your final year, having selected your topic, you are offered six hours of one-to-one dissertation supervision with an expert in your chosen research area. This teaching includes guidance on suitable reading, critical discussion of relevant sources, detailed advice on how to write a 12,000 word piece of research, and intensive critical engagement with your own philosophical position and argument. Through the process of researching and writing a dissertation, the critical skills that you begin to develop in your first year of study (skills that can be put to work in a wide range of careers) are developed to such an extent that you are able to pursue high-level, independent research.</p>
<p>In addition to offering scheduled contact hours, the Department has an open-door policy. You are welcome to call by staff members’ offices or make appointments via email whenever you like. You are also offered three annual workshops, on (1) essay writing, (2) examination technique and (3) choosing second- and third-year modules. All students are invited to attend Royal Institute of Philosophy Lectures, Research Seminars, Undergraduate Philosophy Society talks and other department events.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The Taught MA in Philosophy provides the opportunity for in-depth engagement with areas of philosophy in which the Durham department has internationally recognised expertise. In the process, you will develop critical abilities and independent research skills that prepare you for further postgraduate study in Philosophy and for a wide range of careers where such skills are highly prized.</p>
<p>You can choose three optional ‘topic’ modules from a list of approximately 17. You are also required to take the ‘Philosophical Perspectives’ module and to complete a double-module dissertation. Topic modules are usually taught via seven two-hour seminars and up to four one-to-one tutorials. Seminars incorporate staff-led discussion of topics, student presentations and small group discussions, in the context of a friendly, supportive environment. Seminars serve to (i) familiarise you with topics, positions and debates, (ii) help you to navigate the relevant literature, (iii) refine your oral and written presentation skills and (iv) further develop your ability to independently formulate, criticise and defend philosophical positions. You are expected to do approximately four hours of reading for each seminar. You will also decide upon an essay topic, having received guidance from the module leader. At this point, you begin a more focused programme of reading and independent study, and also benefit from one-to-one supervisions with an expert in the relevant field. These supervisions provide more focused teaching, tailored to your chosen essay topic. Supervisions further enable you to develop and refine your own philosophical positions, convey them clearly and support them with well constructed arguments.</p>
<p>The core modules of the course are the ‘Philosophical Perspectives’ module and the double-module Dissertation. The former consists of seminars of 2 hours duration. These introduce you to different philosophical methodologies and to contrasting conceptions of what philosophy is. Critical refection upon the nature of philosophy, cultured through seminar discussions and subsequent reading, equips them with the ‘meta-philosophical’ skills required to write a ‘Philosophical Perspectives’ essay. Other seminars include training in library use, referencing, writing abstracts, structuring an MA-level essay and other research-related matters. They also include focused advice and discussion concerning dissertation proposals, which you are required to submit as part of this module.</p>
<p>Having completed the three topic modules and the ‘Philosophical Perspectives’ module, you will start work on your Dissertation. You are offered six one-to-one tutorials of up to an hour each, with a supervisor who will be an expert in your chosen field. There is also a Dissertation Workshop during the summer, where you can present work from your Dissertation and receive feedback from members of staff and from peers. The supervisions and the workshop both help to further refine skills acquired during the academic year (such as presenting and defending an argument in a clear, structured fashion) and to complete a substantial piece of high quality independent research. Through the workshop, you will also engage with the work of other students in ways that are mutually informative.</p>
<p>In addition to this core teaching, you will benefit from a range of activities, including a student-led ‘work-in-progress group’ and regular meetings of EIDOS, the department’s postgraduate philosophy society. You are welcomed as full participants in the department’s research culture, and are thus strongly encouraged to attend a range of other events, including weekly Research Seminars, and occasional Royal Institute of Philosophy Lectures, conferences, workshops and reading groups. The Programme Directors remains in regular contact with you throughout the year and are always available to discuss any issues that might arise (personal or academic).</p>

<p>The main group of lectures is given in the first two terms of the academic year (Michaelmas and Epiphany). This part of the lecture course is assessed by examinations. In each term there are two teaching periods of 4 weeks, with a week's break in the middle of the term in which students will be able to revise the material. Most courses are either 8 or 16 lectures in length. There are 14 lectures/week in the Michaelmas term and 14 lectures/week in Epiphany term which are supported by weekly tutorials. In addition, lecturers also set a number of homework assignments which give the student a chance to test his or her understanding of the material.</p>

These subjects are divided into three groups:</p>,<h3>Group 1</h3>,<ul>
<li>Biology</li>

<li>Computer Science</li>
<li>Earth Sciences</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Physics</li>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The key characteristics of the Natural Sciences degree at Durham are choice, flexibility and depth. The Natural Sciences degree has a wide choice of subjects and in later years there is choice between modules within subjects. It is also a flexible degree and with most subjects you can delay choosing your subjects until you get to Durham and you can also change the shape of your degree at the end of the first year.</p>
<p><strong>The Natural Sciences degree has the following features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The degree is based at the Durham campus.</li>
<li>The University operates on a system of undergraduates studying 120 credits each year. There are 20, 40 and a few 60 credit modules, so students choose combinations of modules which add up to precisely 120 credits.</li>
<li>There are two types of degree that you can obtain, a 3-year BSc (degree code CFG0) or a 4-year MSci (degree code FGC0). Both the BSc and the MSci contain BSc Joint Honours and MSci Joint Honours degrees as well as the more broad BSc Natural Sciences and MSci Natural Sciences degrees.</li>
<li>You should note that not all combinations of all modules in all subjects are feasible. Choices are constrained by the limits of the University timetable, which changes every year.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>
<ul>
<li>a BSc Natural Sciences degree in which you study two or more subjects and start a new subject in your second year or carry on with the three subjects you have studied in your first year.</li>
<li>a Joint Honours BSc degree within Natural Sciences which involves studying the same two subjects in each of the three years (it is usually possible to study three or even four subjects in the first year).</li>
<li>take a Year Abroad in between the second and third years.</li>
<li>do a placement in between the second and third years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students on the Natural Sciences course design their own programme, so depending on their choices they learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical classes, fieldwork, informal but scheduled one-on-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing. All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO).</p>
<p>Tutorials, seminars, workshops, and practical classes are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow one-to-one interaction with a member of staff. Practicals also allow hands-on experience of the work of professionals in the disciplines studied on the course. The same is true of fieldwork and consists of engaging in, for example, geological, biological, geographical, or anthropological work in the field with members of academic staff. This emphasis on small-group and practical teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions.</p>
<p>The degrees in Natural Sciences are designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year. Small-group teaching and one-to-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the course) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a major project. In this way the degree systematically transforms the student from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the degree. Students can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars in various academic departments present their cutting-edge research.</p>

The course also provides students with the opportunity to develop skills in research, development, design and project management through individual and team-based project work.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>This is a 12-month full-time course beginning at the start of the academic year and finishing with submitting a report and completing an oral examination on your chosen research and development project. The course consists of four core modules to provide a solid education in a broad range of New and Renewable Energy technologies. A choice of one from two optional modules allows you to choose a study course most suited to your interests and needs. The modules include lecture courses, a group design project and an individual research and development project.</p>
<p>You will select one of two optional modules. These modules typically include 38 hours of lectures in addition to coursework and laboratory experiments, allowing you to develop research skills in parallel with lectures. The modules are designed to increase your understanding in either thermodynamics and fluid mechanics or electrical engineering. You are advised to select the module which you feel would best support your learning needs.</p>
<p>The core lecture modules typically involve 38 hours of lectures and cover topics such as electricity generation from renewable and conventional sources, transmission and distribution (including smart networks), electricity markets and optimisation, and low carbon technologies (including electrical vehicles).</p>
<p>The third core module is a group design project focused on a realistic application of renewable energy technology. You will gain experience of teamwork, presentation skills and project management, as well as the technical aspects of engineering design. You will also benefit from this opportunity to develop their research skills in preparation for your individual research and development project.</p>
<p>A major individual research and development project completes the core modules. This provides an open-ended challenge to each individual student, in collaboration with a staff supervisor. Regular meetings are held with your supervisor to discuss project progress and planning issues. A mid-term assessment is carried out to ensure the project is on track. At the end of the project, you are required to submit a final report on your work, in the style of a research paper. You are also required to prepare and present a poster to encourage further development of your ability to present your work to staff and peers. An oral examination is held to allow detailed questions to be put to you regarding the technical aspects of your project. You should expect to have up to 15 hours of contact time with your supervisors plus over 500 hours of research work and preparation, supported by the School’s technicians and other research workers, over the course of your research projects.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>Lectures deliver basic subject-specific learning, and provide a framework for further study.</p>
<p>Seminars provide opportunities for you to explore issues in greater depth, test your own understanding of the material studied, engage in group work, assess arguments in a group context and defend and debate different opinions. </p>
<p>Workshops are used to allow you to work independently, under supervision, in small groups on questions, problems or case studies and build on subject-specific learning, developing key skills.  </p>
<p>Guided reading and independent study provide a structure within which you exercise and extend your abilities to make use of available learning resources.</p>
<p>Accounting project preparation and supervision foster independent learning and the ability to manage a planned programme of research.   </p>
<p>In particular, the course takes advantage of technology enhanced active learning, where appropriate and, particularly in the context of employability and professional skills, experiential learning techniques.</p>
<p>This course has a holistic approach to the student journey – enhancing the academic aspects of the degree with a schedule of extra-curricular, non-credit bearing components that will aim to develop the skills of the students to improve their opportunities for employment.</p>
<p>The degree will have a clear emphasis on recruitability and employability. In the context of the subject matter of the degree, in the first instance, this will be in relation to accountancy-related careers, however, all graduates will have skills gained through the course and also the non-credit bearing aspects of the degree that should enhance their employment opportunities.</p>
<p>In Year 1, this commences with the first teaching week being devoted to a week-long induction, accounting-related exercise. Formal teaching on the degree modules, therefore, commences in week two of the term. The aims of this exercise are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>To foster a learning community between staff and students on the course (the first year induction exercise is to be staffed by staff teaching on the degree in Year 1 and members of the wider programme team.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To generate group relationships between students, making their initial experiences on the course less daunting.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To introduce the concept of team-work to students – to ensure that group theory is explored, and enable better participation in group activities, both assessed and un-assessed throughout the degree. This should be particularly useful for students whose educational background has not encouraged group participation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To introduce students to the subject of accounting with an absorbing, authentic and inspiring business exercise, which will link to the knowledge and skills introduced in the first year of the programme. We aim to create anticipation for the year ahead.</li>
<li>To explicitly embed the skills required for study in higher education into the curriculum. This is particularly important in terms of our aim for this degree to contribute to widening participation in Higher Education, given its links to employability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the degree is semesterised, exams in the Easter term will be scheduled in Weeks 3 and 4 of the Easter term. The programme team will have a programme of activities for weeks 4 and 5 of the Easter term in Years 1 and 2, as follows:</p>
<h2>Year 1:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Assessment centre and interview training</li>
<li>Employability and recruitability workshops</li>
<li>Workshops introducing the skills needed for Year 2 modules.</li>

<p>In week one of Year 3/4, we have scheduled a week-long Graduate Camp  – the rationale is to re-orientate those who have been on placement into the course and to ensure that all students are ready for the challenge of the final year – the exercise we will develop for this week’s activities will relate to the critical thinking and research aspects of the final year of the degree.</p>
<p>As the course relates to the profession of accountancy, the degree must consider applied as well as theoretical aspects of the study of accounting. Through our close relationships with the major professional accounting bodies and leading employers, we will provide ample opportunities for students to engage with the world of practice and critically appraise how theory and practice meet, through research forums, guest speakers and debates.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The key characteristics of the Natural Sciences degree at Durham are choice, flexibility and depth. The Natural Sciences degree programme has a wide choice of subjects and there is choice between modules within subjects. It is also a flexible degree programme and with most subjects you can delay choosing your subjects until you get to Durham and you can also change the shape of your degree at the end of the first year.</p>
<p><strong>The Natural Sciences degree programme has the following features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The degree programme is based at the Durham campus.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The University operates on a system of undergraduates studying 120 credits each year drawn by combining modules offered by departments.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There are two types of degree that you can obtain, a 3-year BSc (degree code CFG0) or a 4-year MSci (degree code FGC0). The MSci is only available in certain subjects, namely Biology, Computer Science, Chemistry, Earth Sciences, Maths and Physics. Both the BSc and the MSci contain BSc Joint Honours and MSci Joint Honours degrees as well as the more broad BSc Natural Sciences and MSci Natural Sciences degrees. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You should note that not all combinations of all modules in all subjects are feasible. Choices are constrained by the limits of the University timetable, which changes every year.</li>
</ul>
<h4>MSci in Natural Sciences</h4>
<p>To take an MSci in Natural Sciences you must be taking at least one of the following subjects: Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Earth Sciences, Mathematics, and Physics. Biology has a very limited range of modules at fourth year level, so Biology can only be included in a Joint Honours degree with Chemistry or Physics. An MSci in Natural Sciences can be a slight variation from one of the MSci Joint Honours degrees below. Alternatively, it could be just one of the subjects above (say Chemistry) with modules from other subjects (say Anthropology and Philosophy) for the first three years. In this case, your fourth year would have to consist of all six modules from the subject listed above (Chemistry in this case).</p>
<h4>Joint Honours MSci within Natural Sciences</h4>
<p>The MSci is available as a Joint Honours degree in one of five pairs namely:</p>
<p>Biology and Chemistry; Biology and Physics; Chemistry and Maths; Chemistry and Physics; Maths and Physics.</p>
<p>Students on the Natural Sciences programme design their own programme, so depending on their choices they learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical classes, fieldwork, informal but scheduled one-to-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing. All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO).</p>
<p>Tutorials, seminars, workshops, and practical classes are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow one-to-one interaction with a member of staff. Practicals also allow hands-on experience of the work of professionals in the disciplines studied on the programme. The same is true of fieldwork and consists of engaging in, for example, geological, biological, geographical, or anthropological work in the field with members of academic staff. This emphasis on small-group and practical teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the number of formal sessions.</p>
<p>The degree programmes in Natural Sciences are designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year. Small-group teaching and one-to-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the programme) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a major project that makes up a minimum of a third of final year credits. In this way, the degree programme systematically transforms the student from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the programme. Students can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars in various academic departments present their cutting-edge research.</p>

These subjects are divided into three groups:</p>,<h3>Group 1</h3>,<ul>
<li>Biology</li>
<li>Chemistry</li>
<li>Computer Science</li>
<li>Earth Sciences</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Physics</li>
<li>Psychology.</li>
</ul>,<p>At least half of your studies in the second and third years in Natural Sciences must be from the subjects listed in Group 1. Not all subjects can be taken together.</p>,<h3>Group 2</h3>,<ul>
<li>Anthropology</li>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Economics</li>
<li>Geography</li>
<li>Philosophy.</li>
</ul>,<p><strong>No more than half</strong> of your studies in the second and third years can be from subjects in Group 2. Each of these subjects contributes to at least one Joint Honours degree with the subjects from Group 1.</p>,<h3>Group 3</h3>,<p>These subjects are Sport and Education (excluding History of Art) and are based in Durham City. None of the subjects in Group 3 contribute to a Joint Honours degree in Natural Sciences (and so no combination with these subjects is guaranteed to work in the timetable) and no more than half of your studies in the second and third years can be made up of subjects in Groups 2 and 3. If you are interested in taking subjects from Group 3, you are strongly recommended to contact the Natural Sciences Admissions Selector to judge on the feasibility of combining subjects from Groups 1 and 3.</p>,<p>Typically, first-year BSc Natural Sciences students either take three modules from two subjects or modules from three subjects. Other combinations are possible, but this combination would normally allow you to progress with any or all three of these subjects, as well as starting some new subjects in your second year.</p>,<h3>Flexibility and choice</h3>,<p>The degree allows you to choose from a wide choice of subjects to include in your degree. It also allows you to delay the choice about the direction of your studies until the end of your first year (and in some cases to the end of your second year). Each year you can normally change your choice of modules within the first three weeks of the academic year.</p>,<h3>Depth</h3>,<p>The degree requires final-year students to undertake capstone modules which are student driven and involve independent thought, personal management of the work’s direction and are reflective of the degree's learning outcomes. Typically, these modules will have a very small taught component and staff act as mentors, rather than deliverers of information.</p>,<h3>Patterns of study</h3>,<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>,<h2>BSc (Honours) Natural Sciences </h2>,<p>With this route you could study the same three subjects each year. You could also build on your first-year studies in one or two subjects and then combine advanced modules in these subjects with a new subject(s) in your second year.</p>,<p>You could then study two or three subjects in your third year, all of which you must also have studied in earlier years. With this route you would graduate with a BSc (Hons) degree in Natural Sciences with your main subjects studied listed on the degree certificate.</p>,<p>At the end of Year 2, the BSc allows you the option of transferring onto either “with Year Abroad” or “with Placement” pathway.  Note that these options are competitive and so applicants cannot apply for these pathways through UCAS.</p>,<h2>BSc Joint Honours Degrees within Natural Sciences</h2>,<p>With a BSc Joint Honours degree in two subjects, you will study each of these two subjects in all of the three years of study. In the first year, there may be the opportunity to take modules in a third subject, if you wish. If you follow the requirements for a Joint Honours degree you graduate with a BSc Honours degree in A and B within the Natural Sciences degree (where A and B are replaced with the relevant subjects).  If a combination is not offered, it might still be possible for you to combine them with a third subject within a Natural Sciences degree that is not a Joint Honours degree. Please contact the Natural Sciences Admissions Selector for further details.  Note that the “with Year Abroad” and “with Placement” pathways are also offered as added extras with Joint Honours degrees. </p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>You must study at least two subjects, but no more than four, which give you a good progression into your second year subjects.

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The key characteristics of the Natural Sciences degree at Durham are choice, flexibility and depth. The Natural Sciences degree has a wide choice of subjects and in later years there is choice between modules within subjects. It is also a flexible degree and with most subjects you can delay choosing your subjects until you get to Durham and you can also change the shape of your degree at the end of the first year.</p>
<p><strong>The Natural Sciences degree has the following features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The degree is based at the Durham campus.</li>
<li>The University operates on a system of undergraduates studying 120 credits each year. There are 20, 40 and a few 60 credit modules, so students choose combinations of modules which add up to precisely 120 credits.</li>
<li>There are two types of degree that you can obtain, a 3-year BSc (degree code CFG0) or a 4-year MSci (degree code FGC0). Both the BSc and the MSci contain BSc Joint Honours and MSci Joint Honours degrees as well as the more broad BSc Natural Sciences and MSci Natural Sciences degrees.</li>
<li>You should note that not all combinations of all modules in all subjects are feasible. Choices are constrained by the limits of the University timetable, which changes every year.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>
<ul>
<li>a BSc Natural Sciences degree in which you study two or more subjects and start a new subject in your second year or carry on with the three subjects you have studied in your first year.</li>
<li>a Joint Honours BSc degree within Natural Sciences which involves studying the same two subjects in each of the three years (it is usually possible to study three or even four subjects in the first year).</li>
<li>take a Year Abroad in between the second and third years.</li>
<li>do a placement in between the second and third years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students on the Natural Sciences course design their own programme, so depending on their choices they learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical classes, fieldwork, informal but scheduled one-on-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing. All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO).</p>
<p>Tutorials, seminars, workshops, and practical classes are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow one-to-one interaction with a member of staff. Practicals also allow hands-on experience of the work of professionals in the disciplines studied on the course. The same is true of fieldwork and consists of engaging in, for example, geological, biological, geographical, or anthropological work in the field with members of academic staff. This emphasis on small-group and practical teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions.</p>
<p>The degrees in Natural Sciences are designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year. Small-group teaching and one-to-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the course) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a major project. In this way the degree systematically transforms the student from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the degree. Students can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars in various academic departments present their cutting-edge research.</p>

The research training module is taken jointly by all MA students, and all sub-discipline modules will remain available for auditing by any MA student. The degree also facilitates the study of musical repertories from highly diverse international cultural contexts, thereby fostering intercultural dialogue.<br> <br> The design of each specialism will be similar: students must choose modules from lists A, B, C, and D below:<br> <br> A.        A compulsory core 30-credit module<br> B.        A 60-credit pathway-specific module<br> C.        A 60-credit major research project relating to the chosen pathway of specialisation <br> D.        A 30- or 40-credit option, either an optional Music department 30-credit masters module, two Music department undergraduate modules (totaling 40  credits), or a 30-credit masters module in another department </p>,<p> </p>,<h2>A: Core module: Research Methods and Resources (M1)</h2>,<p><br> The core module provides research training and engages with major intellectual issues pertaining to the study of music across all pathways, providing a unified central focus for the degree, in addition to fostering intra-disciplinary connections between the various sub-domains of music studies, as well as interdisciplinary links with other areas of intellectual enquiry in the arts, humanities, and sciences.</p>,<p>This module will set out the intellectual framework for the MA and will impart a foundational understanding of the nature of research in pertinent fields of music studies (both musicological and practice-based), as defined by the AHRC and other UK research councils. It will equip you with the range of knowledge, understanding, and skills necessary to engage in research-informed learning and to conduct independent research at Masters level and beyond, and to function effectively in a professional context.</p>,<p>It will also deal with practical matters such as presentational skills, close reading, and critical thinking, carrying out a literature search and review, research ethics, writing research proposals, and career development. It will provide a solid foundation on which students can proceed with confidence to design, plan, and execute independent research projects. The module will be delivered as weekly seminars. In the first term, the focus will be on a range of theoretical and practical issues pertaining to the conduct of research. The second and third terms will support the development of an independent research project: students will give oral presentations on aspects of their research-in-progress, and receive feedback in the form of student-led group discussions and comment from members of the teaching term.<br> <br> The summative assignments will consist of an extended research proposal, and a conference-style oral presentation.</p>,<h2> </h2>,<h2>B. Pathway-specific modules</h2>,<p>You will be required to take a pathway-specific module according to your proposed area of specialisation, which deepens your understanding and knowledge of that area, and supports your research on a major project undertaken in the same field.</p>,<p>The following pathway-specific modules will be offered every year (the pathway to which they are linked is shown in brackets):<br> <br> M3      Contemporary Musicology (P1)<br> M4      Ethnomusicology in Practice and Theory (P2) <br> M5      Compositional Techniques (P3)<br> M6      Music Performance (P4)<br> M7      Advanced Topics in Music and Science (P5)</p>,<h2> </h2>,<h2>C.

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The course is delivered through a mixture of seminars, practical sessions and one-to-one supervision. Seminars provide opportunities for you to discuss and debate particular issues, and to present your own original work, informed by the knowledge that you have gained through independent study outside the course’s formal contact hours. Practical sessions in areas such as studio or field recording techniques help to prepare you for your own independent work. All students must undertake an independent project (dissertation, composition portfolio, or performance), which is developed with the help of one-to-one expert supervision. Finally, optional modules can be drawn from the undergraduate and postgraduate courses of Music or of other departments –these free-choice modules may involve other forms of staff-student contact, depending on the subject area. The Department actively promotes interdisciplinary approaches to the study of music and you are encouraged to engage with other disciplines in the humanities and sciences.</p>
<p>The contact hours experienced by each individual student will vary considerably, given a high degree of flexibility in the course. You will typically attend between 2 and 4 hours of seminars per week in term time, as well as additional practical sessions as appropriate. Individual supervision of dissertations, performance projects and composition portfolios amounts to an average of 6 hours spread over the second and third terms.</p>
<p>Outside timetabled contact hours, you are also expected to attend research seminars, both student-led and those involving staff or guest academic speakers (typically 1-2 hrs each week during term times). You must also undertake your own independent study to prepare for your classes and assessments, to broaden your subject knowledge and to prepare your dissertations or portfolios. You are encouraged, as an integral part of your studies, to take advantage of other opportunities such as participating in performance opportunities (including staff-led ensembles) and attending research and composition seminars, some of which are organised in conjunction with University research institutes.</p>
<p>There is a busy programme of musical performance, both within and outside the Music department, which complements your academic programme by providing opportunities both to listen to and to perform a wide variety of music. The many musical ensembles to which you can contribute includes both independent societies (including orchestras, choirs, opera and musical theatre as well as a Javanese gamelan) and department-run ensembles such as the New Music Ensemble and Korean percussion group.</p>

</ul>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>As a student on the BA (Hons) Music, you will receive around 7½ hours of timetabled contact per week on average over the degree. This will include a combination of lectures, seminars, and tutorials (including one-to-one supervision), as well as instrumental or vocal tuition and performance and composition workshops. The number and balance of these activities will change over the degree as you develop your knowledge and abilities as an independent learner.</p>
<p>Timetabled contact is only the beginning of your learning. It provides a starting-point for your development as an independent, self-motivated learner. Typically, classroom teaching and learning will form around 25% of the time that you will spend on your studies during the 22 teaching weeks; you will be expected to spend the remaining 75% of your time on independent research. You are also encouraged, as an integral part of your studies, to take advantage of other opportunities including participating in performance groups (including staff-led ensembles) and attending research and composition seminars.</p>
<p>In the first year, you will receive about 9 hours of timetabled contact each week. For each module, weekly lectures will introduce you to the broad questions and current issues in Music and its sub-disciplines. Seminars will give you the opportunity to engage with the topics introduced in lectures, discuss key issues in small groups, and look in detail at music and at writing about music. Instrumental or vocal lessons will help you develop your abilities as a performer, while composition seminars and workshops will allow you to explore approaches to composing. Practical training in both generic study skills and music-specific skills such as using notation software, recording equipment and transcribing music are embedded within the core modules.</p>
<p>For each hour of timetabled contact, you will be expected to complete 3 hours of independent research to prepare for your classes, broaden your subject knowledge, and complete assignments (that is, 27 hours of independent research per week). The teaching methods and coursework will be designed to help you achieve this; for example, you will receive reading lists, assignments, presentation briefs, and online materials to direct your research in preparation for seminars.</p>
<p>In the second year, there is an increased emphasis on the development of critical and analytical skills: a core module concentrates on the development of research skills in musicology. As modules specialise more strongly in particular areas such as performance, composition or different branches of musicology, the type of teaching varies more markedly between modules, so the kind of contact you experience will depend to a great extent on the modules you take. The total contact time you will receive will on average be similar to the first year, around 9 hours per week. As in the first year, you will be expected to complement this with about three times as much independent study as there are contact hours.</p>
<p>In the third year, you will develop further your independent research skills, culminating in a double weighted project, which can be a dissertation, composition portfolio or public performance recital: this counts for one third of your marks for the year. This project will give you the opportunity to engage, at an advanced level, with creative cutting-edge research at the forefront of the discipline. On account of the time that you will need to undertake this research, during the third year you will receive timetabled contact of 4½ hours each week on average. This includes one to one supervision on your project (6 hours for dissertation, 6 for recital or 11 for composition) as well as group classes. The performance strand has 19 group seminars, as well as time for instrumental or vocal lessons. The contact time for dissertation supervisions reflects the text-based nature of the mode of study. Additional hours in the case of the recital and composition projects takes account of their practical nature and the need to investigate and embed further advanced skills specific to the student such as performance practice, notation and instrumental scoring, and the creative use of music technology. Other modules on offer include single-weighted projects in musicology, composition and performance, as well as taught courses in areas of staff research expertise. Overall, during the third year, you will be expected to spend at least 35 hours on independent research each week.</p>
<p>Throughout the degree, you will also have access to an academic adviser who will provide you with academic support and guidance. A student will meet with their adviser three times a year, in addition to which all members of teaching staff have weekly office hours when they are available to meet with students on a ‘drop-in’ basis.</p>
<p>The Department also has an exciting programme of research events (seminars, guest lectures and workshops) which undergraduate students are strongly encouraged to attend. There is a busy programme of musical performance, both within and beyond the walls of the Music Department, which complements students’ academic degree by providing opportunities both to listen to and to perform a wide variety of music. The many musical ensembles to which students can contribute includes both independent societies (including orchestras, choirs, opera and musical theatre as well as a Javanese gamelan) and department-run ensembles such as the New Music Ensemble and Korean percussion group.</p>

These courses are open to students who have an A level (at least grade A) or equivalent qualification in that language. We also offer beginners’ courses in Arabic, German, Italian, Spanish and Russian. Beginners can take cultural modules alongside post-A level students, and completely merge with the advanced stream in the final year.</p>,<p><strong>Here are some examples of how to combine languages:</strong></p>,<ul>
<li>You might choose to study one language (chosen from French, German, Italian, Russian and Spanish [Hispanic Studies]). You will need an A level at the appropriate grade pass in your chosen subject. However, if you wish to study Arabic as a single language, you will need an A level at the appropriate grade pass in at least one other foreign language. You take four modules in the language area of your choice, along with a further two modules in a subsidiary subject of your choice outside the School in both your first and second years. You then take your year abroad and return to your final year to take either six modules in your chosen language or five modules in your chosen language and one module from a subject studied in your second year. Subsidiary subjects may be chosen from those available in departments outside of the School, subject to module availability, individual entry requirements and timetable compatibility.</li>
</ul>,<ul>
<li>You might choose to study two languages (chosen from Arabic, French, German, Italian, Russian and Spanish [Hispanic Studies]). These languages can normally be divided 3 modules +3 modules between two languages, or 4+2 as you prefer (subject to some variation in module availability between the languages).</li>
</ul>,<ul>
<li>You might initially choose to study three languages (chosen from Arabic, French, German, Italian, Russian and Spanish [Hispanic Studies]), which you study in equal proportions (2+2+2). After your first year, you will be required to drop one of these and study no more than two languages in Years 2 and 3. </li>
</ul>,<ul>
<li>There are three ways of combining study of a language and its culture with another subject throughout your degree (with a year abroad). <a href=""https://www.dur.ac.uk/courses/info/?id=17344&amp;title=Combined+Honours+in+Social+Sciences&amp;code=LMV0&amp;type=BA&amp;year=2021"">Combined Honours in Social Sciences</a> and <a href=""https://www.dur.ac.uk/courses/info/?id=18276&amp;title=Liberal+Arts&amp;code=LA01&amp;type=BA&amp;year=2021"">Liberal Arts</a> allow flexible combinations of one or two languages with other subjects, while the <a href=""https://www.dur.ac.uk/courses/info/?id=18406&amp;title=Modern+European+Languages+and+History+with+Year+Abroad&amp;code=RV92&amp;type=BA&amp;year=2021"">Modern European Languages and History</a> degree allows you to study one language (Advanced or Beginners, excluding Arabic) and History in roughly equal proportions.</li>
</ul>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>You will take a core language module for each of the languages you are studying. This is a single module for all languages studied post-A level and a double module for beginners’ languages. These core modules focus on the four skills of reading, writing, speaking and listening. In addition, you will choose from a wide range of modules dealing with various aspects of the literature, film, art, history and politics of the different cultures you are studying. These cultural modules aim to develop students’ independent research and analytical skills as well as introducing them to the cultures in question.</p>,<p>All first-year modules are intended to function as introductions to and more general overviews of areas of study in which you will specialise later in your degree. They have been designed to reflect a commitment to diversity in terms of resources and delivery, and will create opportunities for students to engage in critical analysis of different perspectives relevant to the study area.</p>,<h2>Year 2</h2>,<p>You will continue to take a core language module for each of the languages you are studying. These core modules focus on and continue to develop the four skills of reading, writing, speaking and listening. In addition, you will choose from a wide range of modules on the literature, film, art, history and politics of the cultures you are studying. All second-year modules build on skills and knowledge acquired in the first year and allow you to specialise more in areas which interest you (from medieval literature to contemporary film).</p>,<h2>Year 3</h2>,<p>Your third year is spent abroad and you divide your time between countries whose languages you are going to study at Level 3 in your final year. You can spend this time as an English assistant in a school, as a student in a university and/or in employment of some kind. During your year abroad you will complete a  summative Year Abroad assignment for each of the languages they intend to study at Level 3.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>Typically, you will have 10-11 hours of classroom teaching per week in the three years of your degree in Durham. How much of this is devoted to language learning will depend on how many languages you study (up to three in the first year and up to two in the second and final years). Post-A level core language modules mostly involve 2 teaching hours per week, while beginners’ core language courses in the first year are double modules with 5 or 6 teaching hours per week.</p>
<p>Language classes develop speaking, listening, reading and writing skills as well as grammatical understanding. Optional modules focusing on a wide range of forms of culture (literary and visual) and cultural history are mostly taught by means of weekly lectures and fortnightly seminars, some of which are conducted in the target language.</p>
<p>Classroom teaching is an important part of your learning, but this is only the beginning of your learning. It provides a starting point for your development as an independent, self-motivated learner. The majority of your time will be spent working independently, reading widely, making notes, finding sources of information, listening to and viewing audiovisual materials. For each hour of timetabled classroom teaching, you will be expected to carry out approximately four hours of independent study and research.</p>
<p>A significant proportion of this time will be spent preparing and completing assessment tasks. In core language and specialised translation/interpreting modules, heavy emphasis is placed on assessment as an ongoing element of the learning process, progressively preparing you for written and oral assessments. In cultural modules, most assessment is largely consisting of a mix of essays and written examinations, with oral presentations in some modules. In addition to regular support and feedback from module teachers and conveners, your learning will be supported at the individual level by a personal Academic Adviser, who will meet with you three times a year to discuss your overall progress. This support network continues during the Year Abroad when you are supported by a designated member of staff.</p>
<p>The Year Abroad is a key element in the progressive, developmental education Modern Languages and Cultures at Durham seeks to provide, fostering the accelerated acquisition of language skills and expanding intercultural competence. The amount of time spent on academic study during the Year Abroad will vary according to whether you choose to do work or study placements. You will, however, work independently during your time abroad on preparation for your final-year dissertation and the  summative Year Abroad assignment(s) submitted at the beginning of your final year.</p>
<p>In general, there will be an increasing emphasis on independent learning and research skills, culminating in your final-year dissertation. Rather than imparting detailed information, the main aim of the teaching you receive will be to help you to learn how to learn – guiding you towards using resources effectively, thinking critically and formulating persuasive arguments.</p>

It also aims to encourage you to take personal responsibility for your own learning, team-work and professional conduct.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The course is mainly delivered through a mixture of lectures, tutorials and practical classes. Typically lectures provide key information on a particular area, and identify the main areas for discussion and debate in the Museums sector. Tutorials, seminars and workshops then provide opportunities for you to discuss and debate particular issues or areas, based on the knowledge that you have gained through your lectures and through independent study outside formal contact hours. Finally, practical classes allow you to gain direct experience of practical and interpretative skills in Museum and Artefact Studies through placements and curating an exhibition and/or developing an educational programme for the University Museums.</p>
<p>The balance of these types of activities changes throughout the course, as you develop your knowledge and ability as independent learners , giving you the opportunity to engage in research, professional practice, and developing and demonstrating research skills in a particular area of the subject. The course aims to develop these key attributes thereby preparing you for work or further study once you have completed the course.</p>
<p>In Terms 1 and 2 you will typically attend 6-8 hours a week of lectures, up to 4 hours of tutorials or seminars, in addition to 2 workshops and 4-6 hours of practical sessions working with artefacts or museum environment-related matters as well as fieldtrips over the term. You will have a 20-day Museum placement at Easter in a museum or archive. Outside timetabled contact hours, you are also expected to undertake your own independent study to prepare for your classes and broaden your subject knowledge. Professional speakers are brought in to engage the students with issues within the professional body.</p>
<p>In Term 3 the balance shifts from learning the basic skills required, to applying them within a real-life museum environment in the module Museum Communications where you will work in groups on a specific project(s) with an opening date in May, June or July. Typically, you could be spending the equivalent of a working week as you complete the work for your projects, under supervision.</p>
<p>The move towards greater emphasis on independent research and research continues in Term 3, where the use of research skills acquired earlier in the course are developed through the Dissertation research project or the Research Paper. Under the supervision of a member of academic staff with whom they will typically have between 3 and 5 one-to-one supervisory meetings, you will undertake a detailed study of a particular area resulting in a significant piece of independent research. The Dissertation is regarded as a preparation for further academic work while the exhibition and Research Paper route is designed for a more professional environment.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, all students also have access to an academic adviser who will provide them with academic support and guidance. Typically you will meet your adviser two to three times a year, in addition to which all members of teaching staff have weekly office hours when they are available to meet on a ‘drop-in’ basis. The department also has an exciting programme of weekly one hour research seminars which you are strongly encouraged to attend as well as Friends of the Oriental Museum events.</p>

During the year abroad you complete a summative Year Abroad assignment with guidance from Durham staff.</p>,<p>Students do not take any assessed modules in History during the third year.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>Typically, as a student of Modern European Languages and History you will receive an average of approximately 8 hours of timetabled teaching per week during the three years that the course is delivered in Durham. The amount of contact time that you receive will vary depending on the number and type of modules that you choose to study in the Department of History and the School of Modern Languages and Cultures. Teaching will include a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, and language classes. Lectures introduce broad historical questions and offer contextualisation and critical commentary; seminars provide an opportunity for you to develop your critical skills through discussion; language classes include grammar, oral and audio-visual components and a variety of techniques to develop your language skills.</p>
<p>Classroom teaching is an important part of your learning, but this is only the beginning of your learning. It provides a starting-point for your development as an independent, self-motivated learner. The majority of your time will be spent working independently, reading widely, making notes, finding sources of information, listening to and viewing audiovisual materials. Your independent learning will be supported by extensive resources in the University Library and the Centre for Foreign Language Study’s Open Access Centre, and through resource packages provided through the online learning environment. You will also be encouraged to attend sessions on independent study skills in areas such as using library resources, effective note-taking, contributing to seminars, and writing essays.</p>
<p>The Year Abroad is a key element in the progressive, developmental education that the degree seeks to provide, as it accelerates your acquisition of language skills and expands your intercultural competence. The amount of time spent on academic study during the Year Abroad will vary according to whether you choose to do work or study placements. You will, however, work independently during your time abroad to prepare for your final-year dissertation and the summative Year Abroad assignment submitted at the beginning of the final year.</p>
<p>In the final year, more of your time will be spent conducting independent research. The compulsory dissertation requires you to undertake an independent research project by establishing your own research agenda and exploring extended reading lists. This gives you the opportunity to engage, at an advanced level, with creative cutting-edge research at the forefront of your research topic. Your project will be supported by one-to-one meetings with your supervisor.</p>
<p>In addition to regular support and feedback from module teachers and conveners, your learning will be supported at the individual level by a personal academic adviser, who will meet with you three times a year to discuss your overall progress. This support network continues during the Year Abroad, when every student is supported by a dedicated member of staff. In addition, you will be encouraged to attend the extensive programmes of research-related activities in the Department of History and the School of Modern Languages and Cultures, including research seminars, public lectures from high-profile guest speakers, and other academic events organised by the student-run societies.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>One of the distinctive features of the Durham MA in Literary Studies is that it permits both a broad-based, eclectic study of literary topics from the earliest periods of literature to the present and the possibility of specialisation through designated pathways in such areas as Medieval and Renaissance Studies or Twentieth- and Twenty-First-Century Studies. All students take 3 optional modules, taught in small seminar groups of up to 10, with each module generating 18 hours of contact time (9 seminars x 2 hours) over the academic year. A strong emphasis is placed on independent research, and seminars usually involve a considerable amount of preparation, including short presentations and workshop activities. Assessment for these modules is usually by coursework essay.</p>
<p>All students register for a triple-weighted dissertation, which generates an additional 20 hours of contact time over the first two terms in the form of fortnightly seminars, together with an additional 3.5 hours of dedicated individual supervision time in the third term. Strong emphasis is placed on independent research. In preparation for the MA dissertation, all students submit a 1,000 word research proposal at the beginning of the second term, and are given constructive feedback on it. A draft chapter (approximately 3,500) words will be read and commented upon by their supervisor </p>
<p>Each MA student is assigned an Academic Advisor who can guide and support her or his progress during the course of study.</p>

</ul>,<p>In the Mathematics modules, topics that may be familiar from A level (or equivalent) are expanded and developed to help you adjust to university life, providing a sound foundation for your Mathematics degree and enabling you to make informed choices when picking modules from second year onwards.</p>,<h2>Year 2</h2>,<p>In the second year you will choose six Maths modules.</p>,<p>You will take two compulsory modules:</p>,<ul>
<li>Complex Analysis</li>
<li>Analysis in Many Variables.</li>
</ul>,<p>Together with modules from a range which includes:</p>,<ul>
<li>Numerical Analysis</li>
<li>Statistical Concepts</li>
<li>Mathematical Physics</li>
<li>Algebra</li>
<li>A combination of two shorter courses on a wide range of mathematical topics – Elementary Number Theory, Probability, Mathematical Modelling, Geometric Topology, Monte Carlo, Actuarial Mathematics, and Special Relativity and Electromagnetism.</li>
</ul>,<p>At this stage you can begin to specialise in areas of pure mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics and probability although you can also maintain a wide range of options for the third year.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>Most of the teaching in mathematics consists of 50-minute lectures (12 per week on average) in which lecturers will derive theorems and work through examples, constructing arguments piece by piece and in real time, developing strategies and motivation. The best way to learn Maths is to actually do it by working through problems in tutorials and assignments, so in the first two years lectures are supplemented by tutorials, which are held in groups of about 12 in the first year and 16 in the second. They are informal and provide an opportunity to raise any questions you may have. You will have at least three per week during each of the first two years. Problems are set in lectures on a weekly basis, and your marked solutions may form the topic of discussion in a tutorial or problem class. You will be encouraged to work with other students, and to make use of the University's library and computing resources.</p>
<p>For an honours degree at Durham, you take the equivalent of six single modules each year, each with two lectures a week (apart from the project and teaching modules).</p>
<p>In the first year, five of your modules will cover core material. These form the bedrock of your University education and range over a wide variety of topics. We recognise that our first-year class is not homogeneous; there are different A level syllabuses, and some students have non A level qualifications. Our first-year courses have been designed with this in mind. Consequently, we aim to fill gaps and consolidate previous knowledge during a good deal of the first term although you should find even familiar material presented in an interesting and more sophisticated way.</p>
<p>There are two core modules in the second year. For the remainder of your time you have the opportunity to choose those areas of Mathematics and Statistics which appeal to you most. You can begin to specialise, or if you prefer, study a wide range of subjects.</p>
<p>In the third year, you will take a project module. The project allows you to treat a particular mathematical topic in depth. Typically the projects are organised around fortnightly small group meetings with lecturers and involve presentations and poster design as well as the writing of a detailed dissertation. You are free to choose the remaining four modules from a wide range of options. One option is a teaching module in which you study and observe how pupils learn in school, look at elementary mathematics from an advanced standpoint and look at current educational issues, presenting your findings in a talk and a written report.</p>
<p>We aim to encourage you to develop independence and self-motivation. For that reason we concentrate our tutorial support in the first two years and in the project module, however, help and advice is always available from lecturers. You will also have an advisor assigned to you throughout your time with us who can be relied on for help, in particular in choosing your path through the many modules available.</p>

All around us, massive amounts of increasingly complex data are being generated and collected, for instance, from mobile devices, cameras, cars, houses, offices, cities, and satellites.  Business, research, government, communities, and families can use that data to make informed and rational decisions that lead to better outcomes. It is impossible for any one individual or group of individuals to keep on top of all the relevant data: there is simply far too much. Data science enables us to analyse large amounts of data effectively and efficiently and as a result, has become one of the fastest growing career areas.</p>,<p>Previously, data science was the province of experts in maths and computer science, but the advent of new techniques and increases in computing power mean that it is now viable for non-experts to learn how to access, clean, analyse, and visualize complex data. There is thus a growing opportunity for those already in possession of knowledge about a particular subject or discipline, and who are therefore able to grasp the full meaning and significance of data in their area, to be able to undertake data analysis intelligently themselves. The combination of primary domain knowledge with an expertise in extracting relevant information from data will give those with this ‘double-threat’ a significant employment advantage.</p>,<p>Introductory modules are designed to bring students with non-technical degrees up to speed with the background necessary for data science. This is done on a need-to-know basis, focusing on understanding in practice rather than abstract theory. Core modules then introduce you to the full range of data science methods, building from elementary techniques to advanced modern methods such as neural networks and deep learning. Optional modules allow you to focus on an area of interest.</p>,<p>The course provides training in relevant areas of contemporary data science in a supportive research-led interdisciplinary learning environment.  The broad aims are:  </p>,<ul>
<li>To develop advanced and systematic understanding of the complexity of data, including the sources of data relevant to science, alongside appropriate analysis techniques</li>
<li>To enable students to critically review and apply relevant data science knowledge to practical situations</li>
<li>To develop a critical awareness of current issues in data science which is informed by leading edge research and practice in the field</li>
<li>To develop a conceptual understanding of existing research and scholarship to enable the identification of new or revised approaches to data science practice</li>
<li>To develop creativity in the application of knowledge, together with a practical understanding of how established, advanced techniques of research and enquiry are used to develop and interpret knowledge in data science.</li>
<li>To develop the ability to conduct research into data science issues that requires familiarity with a range of data, research sources and appropriate methodologies and ethical issues.</li>
<li>To develop advanced conceptual abilities and analytical skills in order to evaluate the rigour and validity of published research and assess its relevance to new situations</li>
<li>To extend the ability to communicate effectively both orally and in writing, using a range of media. </li>
</ul>,<p>The degree is designed around a pedagogical framework which reflects the core categories of the data science discipline. </p>,<p>A number of subjects can be identified and defined within each application domain. Whilst a Masters cannot incorporate all subjects, a selection of subjects representative of each domain ensures that the course incorporates the necessary breadth and depth of material to ensure a skilled graduate. </p>,<p>The Masters allows for progressive deepening in your knowledge and understanding, culminating in the research project which is an in-depth investigation of a specific topic or issue.</p>,<p>The global dimension is reinforced through the use of international examples and case studies where appropriate.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The Master of Data Science is research-oriented. Data Science is a driving force behind many subject specialisations today and aspects are delivered within the context of an active and varied research culture as is demonstrated via the associated academics and researchers within the <a href=""http://www.durham.ac.uk/idas/people"">Institute for Data Science</a></p>
<p>Students are also encouraged, through a range of modules, to develop research methods, skills and ethics reflecting the wide range of methods used by the research active staff. Research methodologies are actively taught through many other modules and assessments.  They are also developed through innovative teaching practices such as simulations.  Overall students are encouraged and guided to be ‘research minded’ in all modules, and to develop these critical skills for the future.</p>
<p> All modules taught on this degree are underpinned by research, and embed elements of research training both in the delivery and in the assessment.</p>
<p> The Master of Data Science uses a wide range of learning and teaching methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lectures</li>
<li>Seminars</li>
<li>Workshops</li>
<li>Computer/practical classes</li>
<li>Independent study, research and analysis</li>
<li>Structured reading</li>
<li>Case studies</li>
<li>Data Science Project</li>
<li>Supervisions</li>
<li>Group and individual oral presentations</li>
</ul>
<p>The project is a major research project, conducted and written up as an independent piece of work with support from the student’s appointed supervisor.</p>
<p>Student academic support and guidance is provided through the members of the Management Board, module coordinators, and individual lecturers. This support may take the form of face-to-face contact, telephone, e-mail, or other online contact, as appropriate.</p>
<p>Students also have an appointed Academic Advisor who is able to guide and inform them in their academic development and choice of optional modules.</p>
<p>Information, requirements and expectations regarding the programme overall are provided in the Programme Handbook, which is issued to all students at the beginning of the year and is available on Blackboard Ultra afterwards. This is supplemented information on module aims/learning outcomes, content, key skills, formative and summative assessments and recommended reading.</p>
<p>Academic support to students is initially provided through an induction programme which provides an introduction to the University, the contributing departments, the programme, and key members of staff.</p>

In Philosophy, a wide selection of modules is on offer, addressing the most fundamental questions that arise in diverse areas of human concern, from religion and politics, to morality and the sciences. In Music, the learning of techniques such as harmony, counterpoint, and aural skills are juxtaposed with an investigation of the most up-to-date thinking in musicology, critical theory, composition (acoustic and electroacoustic), analysis, ethnomusicology, cognitive musicology, and performance.</p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>In the first year, you will take the Philosophy core modules of Ethics and Values and Knowledge and Reality. These concern the two broad divisions of Philosophy, delving into Metaphysics and Theory of Knowledge on the one hand, and Moral Philosophy on the other. First-year students also get to choose one of the following Philosophy modules:</p>,<ul>
<li>Introduction to Logic</li>
<li>Introduction to the History and Philosophy of Science</li>
<li>History and Theory of Medicine</li>
<li>Reading Philosophy.</li>
</ul>,<p>Reading Philosophy is a text-based course which examines in depth classic works by writers such as Plato, Hume and Sartre.</p>,<p>In Music, you will take Historical Studies 1 and two other modules from the following list:</p>,<ul>
<li>Introduction to Ethnomusicology</li>
<li>Analysis 1: Elements of Tonal Theory and Practice</li>
<li>Musical Techniques</li>
<li>Composition</li>
<li>Performance 1 – either with recital or essay.</li>
</ul>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>As a student on the course, you will receive around 7½ hours of timetabled contact per week on average over the course of the degree. This will include a combination of lectures, seminars, and tutorials (including one-to-one supervision), as well as instrumental or vocal tuition and performance and composition workshops. The number and balance of these activities will change over the course of the degree as you develop your knowledge and abilities as an independent learner.</p>
<p>Timetabled contact is only the beginning of your learning. It provides a starting-point for your development as an independent, self-motivated learner. Typically, classroom teaching and learning will form around 25% of the time that you will spend on your studies during the 22 teaching weeks; you will be expected to spend the remaining 75% of your time on independent research. You will also be encouraged, as an integral part of your studies, to take advantage of other opportunities including participating in performance groups (including staff-led ensembles) and attending research and composition seminars.</p>
<p>In the first year, you will receive about 9 hours of timetabled contact each week. For each module, weekly lectures will introduce you to the broad questions and current issues in Music and Philosophy. Seminars will give you the opportunity to engage with the topics introduced in lectures, discuss key issues in small groups, and look in detail at musical and philosophical works. Instrumental or vocal lessons will help you develop your abilities as a performer, while composition seminars and workshops will allow you to explore approaches to composing. Practical training in both generic study skills and music-specific skills such as using notation software, recording equipment and transcribing music are embedded within the core modules.</p>
<p>For each hour of timetabled contact, you will be expected to complete 3 hours of independent research to prepare for your classes, broaden your subject knowledge, and complete assignments. The teaching methods and coursework will be designed to help you achieve this; for example, you will receive reading lists, assignments, presentation briefs, and online materials to direct your research in preparation for seminars.</p>
<p>In the second year, there is an increased emphasis on the development of critical and analytical skills. As modules specialise more strongly in particular areas, the type of teaching varies more markedly between modules, so the kind of contact you experience will depend to a great extent on the modules you take. The total contact time you will receive will on average be similar to the first year, around 9 hours per week. As in the first year, you will be expected to complement this with about three times as much independent study as there are contact hours.</p>
<p>In the third year you will develop further your independent research skills, culminating in a double weighted project, which can be a composition portfolio, public performance recital, or dissertation (in either Philosophy or Music): this counts for one third of your marks for the year. This project will give you the opportunity to engage, at an advanced level, with creative cutting-edge research. On account of the time that you will need to undertake this research, during the third year you will receive timetabled contact of 4½ hours each week on average. This includes one-to-one supervision on your project (6 hours for dissertation, 6 for recital or 11 for composition) as well as group classes. The performance strand has 19 group seminars, as well as time for instrumental or vocal lessons. The contact time for dissertation supervisions reflects the text-based nature of the mode of study. Additional hours, in the case of the recital and composition projects, take account of their practical nature and the need to investigate and further embed student-specific advanced skills in areas including performance practice, notation and instrumental scoring, and the creative use of music technology. Other modules on offer include single-weighted projects in ethics, aesthetics, metaphysics, musicology, composition and performance. Overall, during the third year, you will be expected to spend at least 35 hours on independent research each week.</p>
<p>Throughout the degree, you will also have access to an academic adviser who will provide you with academic support and guidance. A student will meet with their adviser three times a year, in addition to which all members of teaching staff have weekly office hours when they are available to meet with students on a ‘drop-in’ basis.</p>
<p>Both departments also have exciting programmes of research events (seminars, guest lectures and workshops) which undergraduate students are strongly encouraged to attend. There is a busy programme of musical performance, both within and beyond the walls of the Music department, which complements students’ academic degree by providing opportunities both to listen to and to perform a wide variety of music. The many musical ensembles to which students can contribute includes both independent societies (including orchestras, choirs, opera and musical theatre as well as a Javanese gamelan) and department-run ensembles such as the New Music Ensemble and Korean percussion group.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The full-time MBA Programme is delivered through a mixture of sessions including lectures, case studies, individual and group presentations. Some sessions are delivered by guest speakers who are practitioners in the field.</p>
<p>Students study 7 core modules, and select 5 elective modules which enables them to undertake more in-depth study of particular topics. This is followed by a 15,000 word dissertation or Business Project to allow students to carry out independent research and develop their skills in analysis and scholarly expression, using an appropriate theoretical framework. They are supported in writing their dissertation through the study of research methods, and attending individual meetings with an allocated supervisor, who monitors their progress and provides advice. Where students choose to complete a Business Project rather than a Dissertation, this can be self-sourced or arranged by Durham Business School. The Business Project allows an opportunity to put new skills into practice in the real world, working on a live project with a regional, national or international company.</p>
<p>Students will typically attend 20 hours per week of core teaching in Term 1. In Terms 2 and 3 students would, on average (and dependent on elective choices), attend 12.5 hours per week of core and elective teaching. In addition, students have the following opportunities:</p>
<p>(1) A Boardroom Simulation Activity in Term 2, integrating academic learning from core modules into a live boardroom situation (compulsory)</p>
<p>(2) An International Study Week at an overseas location in Term 2, giving students the opportunity to learn about the business, economy and culture of another country, gain an ‘insider perspective’ on international businesses and network with key business staff.</p>
<p>(3) A Charity Consultancy Project in Term 3</p>
<p>Our MBA “Leading Edge Programme” incorporates skills development, career management and the Durham Speaker Series and runs throughout the academic year. Students have the opportunity of unrestricted individual meetings with a Career Consultant throughout the year and during induction they attend a three-day Personal and Team Development residential activity and additional workshops over three days. In Term 1, students can attend 19 hours of various workshops; 29 hours in Term 2 and 21 hours in Term 3 to enhance their interpersonal skills and career management. Students also have the opportunity to participate in the London City tour, the monthly Durham Speaker Series events and the Annual Durham Convention.</p>
<p>Outside of timetabled contact hours, students are expected to undertake their own independent study in preparation for teaching sessions, assignments and other forms of assessment including exams, and general background reading to broaden their subject knowledge. All members of teaching staff are also available to provide additional support on a one-to-one basis via weekly consultation hours.</p>

The Business School, in association with the University, will assist students in applying for a study abroad place, but it is the responsibility of the student to apply for such a place, and the right of the Business School/University to allocate students to available places as it deems best. In the event that a student is unable to obtain a study abroad place, transfer to the equivalent ‘non-study abroad’ programme is guaranteed provided the student is eligible to transfer on academic grounds. In line with Home Office rules, students from outside the EU will transfer onto the ‘with study abroad’ programme only once they have successfully secured a placement (normally at the end of their second year of study).

This emphasis on small-group teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions. In fact, the degree programme is designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year.</p>
<p>Small-group teaching and one-on-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the programme) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a capstone dissertation– supported by one-on-one supervision – that makes up a third of final year credits. In this way the degree programme gives the student the opportunity to transform from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life.</p>
<p>These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the programme.</p>

In fact, the degree programme is designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year.</p>
<p>Small-group teaching and one-on-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the programme) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a capstone dissertation– supported by one-on-one supervision – that makes up a third of final year credits. In this way the degree programme gives the student the opportunity to transform from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life.</p>
<p>These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the programme.</p>
<p>Students can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars present their cutting-edge research.</p>

</ul>,<h2>Year 3</h2>,<p>All of our degrees offer you the option of spending your third year gaining practical experience on a business placement. Business placements are a great way to develop your employment marketability and to engage with employers early in their recruitment pipeline. We actively encourage you to explore this as an option within your degree. A placement requires a minimum of forty weeks of work experience and the placement begins in the summer following completion of the second year, and this then becomes the third year of a four-year degree programme. This allows you to really explore and understand your job and to find out if the career or company is for you.</p>,<ul>
<li>You will develop your practical skills, confidence and maturity.</li>
<li>You can focus on a specific career path -many employers recruit graduates from their placement programme.</li>
<li>You will be able to contextualise your studies better, be more mature in your attitude to work.</li>
<li>You may decide to draw on your working experiences and access a more fulfilling dissertation research subject.</li>
<li>You will gain invaluable job search and graduate research skills by engaging in the competitive placement recruitment process.</li>
</ul>,<p>To ensure you are getting the most out of your experience, we support your placement in a number of ways:</p>,<p><strong>First Year Bootcamps and Workshops</strong> help you to develop your Placement Strategy and to identify and develop those skills and competencies that will be critical to ensure you are attractive to potential placement employers. These typically involve Employers, Placement Mentors, representatives from Colleges, Societies and the Volunteering Community in Durham.</p>,<p><strong>Second Year Workshops</strong> support you through the placement application process and allow you to develop into a supportive student group to travel along the road of gaining a placement together. They enable you to get to know those students who will return with you in the fourth year. Workshops typically involve employers, and former placement students.</p>,<p><strong>The DUBS Placement Programme</strong> includes a series of employer-led events which take place throughout term 1 and 2 and is open to all first year and second year placement students. The skills sessions and networking events allow students to develop essential employability skills as well as providing valuable insight into the recruitment process.</p>,<p><strong>Placement Mentors </strong>We have a mentorship scheme whereby former placement students share their experiences of the application process and placement with first and second year students and those out on placement. . If you become a placement mentor on your return to University you can continue to develop your interpersonal skills and slide back into your University life with another key role which may well develop a new sense of belonging as well as another valuable contribution to your CV</p>,<p><strong>Placement Tutors </strong>Whilst you are on placement you are assigned a tutor who will visit you, liaise with your employer and ensure you gain the most from your experience.</p>,<p>The Business Placement year fees are set annually by the University.  For the definitive amount of the Business Placement year fees payable please contact our <a href=""mailto:business.placements@durham.ac.uk"">Placement Team</a>.</p>,<p>*The offer of a place on a ‘with placement’ degree does not imply that Durham University Business School guarantees to find the student a placement. The Business School, in association with the University, will assist students in finding and applying for placements, but it is the responsibility of the student to apply for and to obtain a placement (which is subject to approval by the Business School). In the event that a student is unable to obtain a placement, transfer to the equivalent ‘non-placement’ programme is guaranteed provided the student is eligible to transfer on academic grounds. In line with Home Office rules, students from outside the EU will transfer onto the ‘with business placement’ programme only once they have successfully secured a placement (normally at the end of their second year of study). Therefore due to visa requirements, we recommend that international students interested in the business placement year as part of their degree apply for this programme when making their application to us via UCAS.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>This is a 12-month full-time course beginning at the start of the academic year and finishing with you submitting a report and completing an oral examination on your chosen research and development project. The course consists of four core modules to provide a solid education in a broad range of Advanced Mechanical Engineering technologies. A choice of one from two optional modules allows you to choose a study course most suited to your interests and needs. The modules include lecture courses, a group design project and an individual research and development project.</p>
<p>You will select one of two optional modules. These modules typically include 38 hours of lectures in addition to coursework and laboratory experiments, allowing you to develop research skills in parallel with lectures. The modules are designed to increase your understanding of either fluid dynamics and thermodynamics or applied mechanics.  You are advised to select the module which you feel would best support your learning needs.</p>
<p>The core lecture modules typically involve 38 hours of lectures and cover topics such as computational stress analysis, fluid mechanics and turbomachinery design. </p>
<p>The third core module is a group design project focused on a realistic application of mechanical engineering technology. You will gain experience in teamwork, presentation skills and project management, as well as the technical aspects of engineering design. You also benefit from this opportunity to develop your research skills in preparation for your individual research and development project.</p>
<p>A major individual research and development project completes the core modules. This provides an open-ended challenge to each individual student, in collaboration with a staff supervisor. Regular meetings are held with your supervisor to discuss project progress and planning issues. A mid-term assessment is carried out to ensure the project is on track. At the end of the project, you are required to submit a final report on your work, in the style of a research paper. You are also required to prepare and present a poster to encourage further development of your ability to present your work to staff and peers. An oral examination is held to allow detailed questions to be put to you regarding the technical aspects of your project. You should expect to have up to 15 hours of contact time with your supervisor plus over 500 hours of research work and preparation, supported by the School’s technicians and other research workers, over the course of your research projects</p>

Taught modules are delivered by a mixture of lectures and seminars. Although most lectures do encourage participation, they are used primarily to introduce chosen topics, identify relevant concepts, and introduce you to the main debates and ideas relevant to the chosen topic. They give you a framework of knowledge that you can then develop, and reflect on, through your own reading and study.</p>
<p>Seminars are smaller-sized, student-led classes. You are expected to carry out reading prior to classes, and are usually set questions or problems to which to apply the knowledge they have developed. Through class discussion, or the presentation of papers, you are given the opportunity to test and refine your knowledge and understanding, in a relaxed and supportive environment.</p>
<p>The number of contact hours in each module will reflect that module’s credit weighting. 15-credit modules will have, in total, 15 contact hours (of either lectures or seminars); 30-credit modules will have 30 contact hours. You must accumulate, in total, between 90 and 120 credits of taught modules for the course (depending upon the length of their dissertation).</p>
<p>In addition to your taught modules, all students must produce a dissertation of between 10,000 and 20,000 words. This is intended to be the product of your own independent research. You will be allocated a dissertation supervisor, and will have a series of (usually four) one-to-one meetings with your supervisor over the course of the academic year.</p>

It is possible, therefore, for students to combine <em>History and Politics</em>, for example, but also to study subjects in combinations less likely to be available in a Joint Honours programme, such as <em>Theology and Anthropology</em>, or <em>Music and Sociology</em>, or <em>Philosophy and Geography</em>.</p>,<p>If the subject which you regard as your primary interest is in the <em>Social Sciences</em>, you should apply for the <a href=""course/LMV0"">Combined Honours in Social Sciences</a> degree.</p>,<p>If your principal subjects include one or more modern languages – <em>French</em>, <em>German</em>, <em>Spanish</em>, <em>Italian</em>, <em>Russian</em>, <em>Arabic</em>, <em>Chinese</em>, or <em>Japanese</em> – then, at the end of your first year, you would transfer to the four-year version of your degree, and spend your third year abroad, either studying at university, or teaching English, or undertaking internships in companies and other organisations. If, however, you do not wish to take any subject other than modern languages, you should apply for the <a href=""course/R002"">Modern Languages and Cultures</a> degree.</p>,<p>If you are offered a place in one of the University’s international exchange degrees, then, during your second year, you would also transfer to the four-year version of your degree.</p>,<p>Liberal Arts, like its predecessor, <em>Combined Honours in Arts</em>, appeals to highly-qualified, self-motivated, and independent-minded students, who are seeking to make creative connections between their subjects. It offers exceptional flexibility, and the opportunity to study in some of the UK’s most prestigious departments in the Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences.</p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>In your first year, you will study six modules, in three or four subjects.</p>,<h2>Year 2</h2>,<p>In your second year, you will study six modules, in two, three, or four subjects.</p>,<h2>Year 3 (Year 4 if undertaking a Year Abroad)</h2>,<p>In your final year, you will complete a research project in your primary subject, and study four other modules, in two or three subjects.</p>,<p>As a Liberal Arts student, you will be focusing on subjects in the <em>Arts and Humanities</em>, but you will be able to take up to half of your modules each year in subjects in the <em>Social Sciences.</em></p>,<h3>In the Arts and Humanities, the subjects currently available are as follows:</h3>,<ul>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>Typically, you will have 12 hours of classroom teaching per week in the three years of your degree based in Durham. Language modules involve six hours per week of teaching, while modules on culture, history and other topics are usually taught by means of weekly lectures and fortnightly seminars.</p>
<p>Classroom teaching is an important part of your learning, but this is only the beginning. It provides a starting point for your development as an independent, self-motivated learner. The majority of your time will therefore be spent working independently, reading widely, making notes, finding sources of information, listening to and viewing audio-visual materials. For each hour of timetabled classroom teaching you will therefore be expected to carry out approximately four hours of independent study and research.</p>
<p>A significant proportion of this time will be spent preparing and completing assessment tasks, both formative and summative. In core language modules, heavy emphasis is placed on formative assessment as an ongoing element of the learning process, progressively preparing you for written and oral assessments. In other modules, most assessment is largely consisting of a mix of essays and written examinations.</p>
<p>In addition to regular support and feedback from module teachers and conveners, your learning will be supported at the individual level by a personal Academic Adviser, who will meet with you three times a year to discuss your overall progress. This support network continues during your Year Abroad when you will be supported by a designated member of staff.</p>
<p>Your Year Abroad is a key element in the progressive, developmental education that Japanese Studies at Durham seeks to provide, fostering the accelerated acquisition of language skills and expanding intercultural competence. You will work independently during your time abroad in preparation for your final-year dissertation and the summative Year Abroad assignment submitted at the beginning of your final year.</p>
<p style=""background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;"">In general, there will be an increasing emphasis on independent learning and research skills, culminating in the final-year dissertation.

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>This course involves both taught modules and a substantial dissertation component. Taught modules are delivered by a mixture of lectures and seminars. Although most lectures do encourage student participation, they are used primarily to introduce chosen topics, identify relevant concepts, and introduce you to the main debates and ideas relevant to the chosen topic. They give you a framework of knowledge that you can then develop, and reflect on, through your own reading and study.</p>
<p>Seminars are smaller-sized, student-led classes. You are expected to carry out reading prior to classes, and are usually set questions or problems to which to apply the knowledge they have developed. Through class discussion, or the presentation of student papers, students are given the opportunity to test and refine their knowledge and understanding, in a relaxed and supportive environment.</p>
<p>The number of contact hours in each module will reflect that module’s credit weighting. 15-credit modules will have, in total, 15 contact hours (of either lectures or seminars); 30-credit modules will have 30 contact hours. Students must accumulate, in total, between 90 and 120 credits of taught modules for the course (depending upon the length of their dissertation).</p>
<p>In addition to taught modules, you must produce a dissertation of between 10,000 and 20,000 words. This is intended to be the product of your own independent research. Each student is allocated a dissertation supervisor, and you will have a series of (usually four) one-to-one meetings with their supervisor over the course of the academic year.</p>
<p>Finally, all taught postgraduate students on this course, are encouraged to attend the various events, including guest lectures and seminars, organised through the School’s research centres, including the Institute for Commercial and Corporate Law, and Durham European Law Institute.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>Teaching is at the centre of the activities of the School of Government and International Affairs, where you will enjoy a vibrant and challenging intellectual environment. The School places great importance on research-led teaching, which integrates new and cutting-edge research into the curriculum and will introduce you to a variety of research-oriented skills and research-based projects. Teaching takes the form of lectures and small group seminars, with an emphasis on encouraging our students to become independent thinkers, able to locate, analyse, and question subject material with the skills learned in the course of their studies.</p>
<p>Students on this degree learn through a diversity of assessment methods, including but not limited to examinations and unseen essay questions, essays, group projects, and a dissertation. Modules are assessed during the year of study, with each module offering multiple chances for assessment and feedback on student work. In your final year, you will submit a dissertation, which allows you to explore in depth a topic of your choice. You will be assigned a supervisor to assist you in the design and production of your dissertation.</p>
<p>All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO). Seminars provide the opportunity for students to engage in discussion of a particular topic and/or to explore it in more detail than might be covered in a lecture. Student participation is an important part of seminars. This emphasis on small-group teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the number of formal sessions.</p>
<p>Small-group teaching and one-to-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the degree) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a dissertation – supported by one-on-one supervision – that makes up a third of final year credits.</p>
<p>In this way, the degree systematically transforms you from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the course and continue at key times throughout each year of the degree.</p>
<p>Our degree, through the diversity of assessments, simulations, independent learning, and various classroom based activities aim to provide you with multiple opportunities to develop a range of important transferable and employability skills including: complex problem solving, critical thinking, creativity, people management, coordinating work others, time management, judgment and decision making, and cognitive flexibility.</p>
<p>As a student in the School of Government and International Affairs, you can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff, guest speakers, and visiting scholars present their cutting edge research.</p>

Modules will be delivered primarily through small group seminars. Attendance is mandatory for these seminars, which have been chosen as the primary means of delivering material to students due to the advanced nature of the course. Small group seminars encourage participation and the development of communications skills. They also allow you to benefit from close contact with the academics teaching on the course, many of which are also experienced practitioners and consultants in their respective fields of expertise.</p>,<p>The compulsory modules ensure that you develop an in-depth understanding of the fundamentals of international law and governance and become familiar with current debates in the field.</p>,<p>Optional modules then allow you to explore particular aspects of international law and governance, such as aspects of international and regional law, international dispute settlement, international human rights, international humanitarian law and international economic law, in greater depth.</p>,<p>The completion of optional modules, together with the dissertation, allow for the development of your ’<em>subject specific knowledge</em> as the course progresses. The development of your skills is achieved mainly through the combination of the compulsory module in Applied Research Methods in Law, taught in Michaelmas term, and your dissertation, supervision for which begins at the start of Epiphany term. Through these modules, you can practise your skills intensely, whilst continuing to acquire a deeper level of specialised knowledge on your chosen topic. </p>,<p>An important objective of the LLM in International Law and Governance course is to provide you with skills that will enable them to thoroughly analyse and interpret legal sources, literature, and cases, and to research and formulate an independent opinion on international legal questions. You will also learn to clearly present your findings both orally and in writing to international legal specialists, to participate actively in academic debate, and to apply this advanced academic knowledge in public international law in a professional context.</p>,<p>As such, an LLM in International Law and Governance will provide you with an excellent foundation to pursue an international law career, whether it is in legal practice, employment in international institutions, or employment in non-governmental organisations. The LLM qualification will also be an excellent vehicle for the further development of research skills and, as such, also offers entry into further postgraduate study and, in particular, doctoral research.</p>,<h2>Core modules:</h2>,<ul>

</ul>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>This course involves both taught modules and a substantial dissertation component. Taught modules are delivered by a mixture of lectures and seminars. Although most lectures do encourage student participation, they are used primarily to introduce chosen topics, identify relevant concepts, and introduce you to the main debates and ideas relevant to the chosen topic. They give you a framework of knowledge that you can then develop, and reflect on, through your own reading and study.</p>
<p>Seminars are smaller-sized, student-led classes. You are expected to carry out reading prior to classes, and are usually set questions or problems to which they will apply the knowledge they have developed. Through class discussion, or the presentation of papers, you are given the opportunity to test and refine your knowledge and understanding, in a relaxed and supportive environment.</p>
<p>The number of contact hours in each module will reflect that module’s credit weighting. 15-credit modules will have, in total, 15 contact hours (of either lectures or seminars); 30-credit modules will have 30 contact hours. You must accumulate, in total, between 90 and 120 credits of taught modules for the course (depending upon the length of their dissertation).</p>
<p>In addition to taught modules, you must produce a dissertation of between 10,000 and 20,000 words. The dissertation is intended to be the product of your own independent research. Each student is allocated a dissertation supervisor, and will have a series of (usually four) one-to-one meetings with their supervisor over the course of the academic year.</p>
<p>Finally, all taught postgraduate students on this course, are encouraged to attend the various events, including guest lectures and seminars, organised through the School’s research centres, including Law and Global Justice at Durham, the Human Rights Centre, the Centre for Criminal Law and Criminal Justice, and the Durham European Law Institute.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The course is delivered through a mixture of lectures, seminars and webinars, tutorials and workshops with visits to relevant heritage sites.</p>
<p>Lectures underpin the core knowledge requirements of the degree by introducing students to key concepts, methodologies and analytical approaches. They also serve as examples of research-led critical analysis and applied expertise, thus demonstrating to students both subject-specific knowledge and the key skills necessary to acquire and communicate this. As well as more traditional podium-based approach, lectures are combined with interactive seminar-style discussions. These are delivered by specialists from within the Department and elsewhere in the University as well as from national and international heritage institutions and sites, including World Heritage Sites.</p>
<p>Webinars are used to introduce students to specific heritage sites and issues around the world in real-time debate with international professionals by video link. These case study presentations are followed by seminar discussions mediated by the module convenor. </p>
<p>A variety of seminars take place in different modules with different formats and distinct learning goals.  This learning methodology encourages students to explore discussions in depth, learn to marshal their arguments in a group setting and respond appropriately to a diverse range of informed opinions. Students are exposed to, and expected to produce, a variety of different presentations in seminars and to contribute effectively and appropriately to the subsequent debate to encourage critical thinking. Formative assessment is given as relevant.</p>
<p>Reading seminars encourage independent learning and critical reflection. Students are required to read and consider specified texts or cultural heritage exemplars before the seminar discussions.</p>
<p>Student-led seminars require students to prepare either an individual presentation or construct and contribute to group presentations. Presentations in these test students’ abilities to identify key topics, reflect on, and analyse, these using appropriate methods. Some of these seminars focus on work-in-progress, allowing students to demonstrate subject-specific analytical skills and their ability to apply self-reflectively subject-related knowledge and theoretical models to a particular case study or issue. Skills at constructing and synthesising complex arguments clearly are tested both in producing the presentation and defending their argument appropriately while demonstrating an independent approach to learning, thinking self-critically and creatively as well as problem-solving. Self-expression, the ability to make coherent arguments and the capacity to contribute effectively and appropriately to debates are also tested in these seminars.</p>
<p>The Poster Debate requires students to prepare a poster using appropriate IT and prepare an accompanying hand-out for their peers, communicating their analysis of the case study of a heritage site they identified and researched prior to starting the course. This debate has multiple functions: it encourages the students to interact as a cohort early on in the MA programme, provides an opportunity for exchanging ideas and issues and starts to develop supporting research resources using the required citation format. During the debate itself, students give a summary of the poster and answer questions from their peers. Posters require the succinct presentation of information and analysis and so test students’ ability to condense findings to the most important elements without losing valuable focus and to crease a visually appealing written presentation using charts and figures as appropriate. This learning activity replicates a common professional mode of communication in the sector. It offers students the opportunity to reflect on issues of design and the use of text and images to communicate complex information and ideas in a specific format and to engage in active debate. Written formative feedback will be provided to students on their presentations, handouts and contributions to debate supported by discussion in one-to-one tutorials with the aiming of enhancing the development of their summative assignment.</p>
<p>The Scenario Analysis Work-in-Progress Seminar requires students to give presentations on the site or organization which they have selected for the Scenario Analysis. They present the first phase of the study including a justification of their choice of site/organization, a review of the nature of this site/organization and one of the future plan scenarios. This presentation provides a moment of critical self-reflection on progress for the individual student and also enables them to benefit from debate with their peers and formative feedback from the Module Convenor </p>
<p>The Professional Practice Project and Dissertation Research Work-in-Progress Seminar requires students to give presentations of their research and professional project work in progress. These presentations provide a moment of critical self-reflection on progress for the individual student by requiring them to outline research so far undertaken and justify their chosen theoretical framework and methodologies. It also offers an opportunity for students to provide critical feedback to their peers and exchange ideas, problems and solutions.  Formative feedback is provided by the Module Convenor. In this way, these seminars serve as the summation of the process of reflective practice begun at the start of the MA.</p>
<h4>Professional Placements</h4>
<p>These are designed to offer students the opportunity to develop and apply the knowledge, understanding and skills acquired elsewhere in the taught MA programme and put their learning into practice by reflecting on and integrating their experience in the workplace in their course work. The placements are set up by the Course Director and are project-based. Students will undertake appropriate research, develop proposals and implement the project to an agreed level, depending on the different host institutions and the project goals.  The aim is to ensure that the outcome of a placement is a completed project ‘product’ which should be of benefit to both the host institution and the student.  A Professional Practice Research Project is available for students for whom a Placement is not an appropriate choice. In this, students identify and research a key issue in contemporary professional practice in cultural heritage and produce a comparable portfolio. </p>
<h4>Reflective Practice</h4>
<p>Students are encouraged to maintain a Reflective Practice Log throughout the programme. They are introduced to the concept and practice of Reflective Practice at the start of the programme in order to ensure their effective engagement with this learning and self-development tool. Maintaining a Reflective Practice Log throughout the programme enables them to record and reflect on their personal and professional development in a structured way and help them identify their strengths and weakness and identify areas for further learning. This approach will enable them to reflect on and deepen their learning, research and professional practice and provides a framework for independent learning as well as providing a link to professional practice.  This Log will also provide a bridge between the different modules as well as feeding into assignments including the Placement / Professional Practice portfolios. It will be used to inform one-to-one tutorials and help to frame the concluding Analytical Case Study Report or Dissertation. Students will be provided with an initial framework for the Log’s content although it may take different physical formats. However, students will be required to create a log in a format accessible to the module convenor and submit it prior to appropriate tutorials. For a programme which has ambitions to link theory and practice, academia and professional, this is the ideal model to enable students to manage and develop their own intellectual and professional expertise. </p>
<h4>Visits/Field Trips</h4>
<p>These provide an enhanced learning experience of subject material uniquely available in specific locations. Learning and teaching on the Durham World Heritage site is central to this programme.</p>
<h4>Self-guided Learning</h4>
<p>Comprising personal study but supported by group discussions and feedback in seminars, this is an essential element of MA level learning. Students will undertake self-driven research, revision, problem-solving and critical evaluation on topics and concepts associated with lectures, workshops, seminars and assignments. In this process they will be assisted by using the Reflective Log (see above) and group and individual tutorials.</p>
<h4>Professional Practice Project / Dissertation</h4>
<p>These projects enable students on both routes to select, design, execute and communicate an extended piece of research in either M4 Professional Practice Project or M5 Dissertation. These modules provide students with the opportunity to extend and apply knowledge and learning achieved in preceding modules, enhance and apply their methodological skills and demonstrate their ability in identifying and analysing relevant theoretical models, literature and data in an extended professional piece of writing at appropriate scholarly and academic standards. Analytical Case Study Reports and Dissertations will be supported by a designated individual with relevant subject-specific knowledge and/or experience.  As noted above, the Reflective Practice Log will support the development of this research process.</p>
<h4>Tutorials</h4>
<p>These provide a forum for a student-centred discursive engagement, sometimes as a group but also a one-to-one basis. </p>
<p>Group tutorials are intensive, small-group sessions that allow a more personalised interaction than may be possible in a seminar or lecture context. They serve to complement lectures and workshops. Tutorials enable an atmosphere in which student questions are encouraged and where they are provided with an opportunity to address subjects which are proving particularly difficult. They allow the Module Convenor to get to know students and address potential problems at an early stage.  One-to-one tutorials provide the opportunity to address individual student’s learning progress and goals in a relatively informal learning environment. Tutorials enable learners to develop, discuss, question and receive feedback on the full range of their subject-specific knowledge and critical understanding and may be integrated into specific modules such as the Professional Practice Project and the Dissertation. The Reflective Practice Log is used during placements as a framework for reflecting on progress.<strong> </strong></p>

The emphasis is on osteoprofiling, as well as health and disease using a multidisciplinary approach, linking biological evidence with cultural data (the biocultural approach). This is a very hands-on, practical course, and students will gain experience with human skeletal remains from a variety of time periods.</p>,<p>This course is unique in the world and it takes a holistic view of the body and society and will prepare you for undertaking significant research projects in this subject, or working in contract/commercial archaeology, and many other fields. It is aimed at graduates mainly in archaeology and anthropology with or without past experience or knowledge in this field, and for those who aspire to continue on to PhD or work in contract archaeology. However, past students have come from a variety of subject backgrounds, and destination data illustrates a wide range of employers take these students.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The course is delivered through an exciting and challenging mixture of lectures, seminars and hands-on practical classes. Lectures provide key information on a particular area and identify the main areas for discussion and debate in bioarchaeology. Seminars then provide opportunities for smaller groups to discuss and debate issues or areas, based on the knowledge that you have gained through your lectures and through independent study outside the programme’s formal contact hours. Finally, practical laboratory classes allow you to gain direct practical skills in recording and interpretation of data from skeletal remains. We have a dedicated human osteology laboratory at Durham and curate large collections of human skeletal remains, including many pathological examples. These are an important component of the course, facilitating independent and group work, as well as hands-on experience under laboratory conditions, essential for a potential future working environment. You will have access to the human bone laboratory for independent study outside of formal teaching hours and we encourage you to use these resources as much as possible.</p>
<p>The balance of these types of activities changes throughout the course, as you develop your knowledge and ability as independent learners. You will have the opportunity to engage in research, professional practice, and to develop and demonstrate research skills in subject areas that interest you. In addition to the taught components, a series of informal ‘open lab’ sessions form part of the learning experience. We also offer guest lecturers and seminars. You will be part of a vibrant bioarchaeology community here at Durham!</p>
<h3>Term 1</h3>
<p>You will take <em>Osteoprofiling</em>, taught through lectures and practical laboratory sessions. In this module you will learn all aspects of skeletal analysis, including bone fragment identification, techniques of sex determination, estimating age-at-death (children and adults) and metrical and non-metrical assessment. As well as experience with different skeletons each week, you will be given a skeleton to work on and to present a report on at the end of term. This term you will also take <em>Research and Study Skills in Archaeological Science</em>, which includes lectures, workshops and practical sessions on both generic and specific archaeological science research skills. External speakers specialising in specific subject areas from “industry” and academia are invited to deliver lectures on issues related to both research and the broader profession. </p>
<h3>Term 2</h3>
<p>The focus this term is on developing skills for palaeopathological analysis, as well as gaining an understanding of multidisciplinary approaches to interpretation.  In <em>Palaeopathology: Theory and Method</em> you will learn how to record and diagnose different types of diseases in human skeletal remains, delivered via lectures and hands-on practical experiences using our extensive pathological collections.</p>
<p>You have a choice of:</p>
<p><em>Themes in Palaeopathology</em> in which you will develop your critical approach to the evaluation of multiple forms of evidence, to help contextualise and interpret the human skeletal evidence for the reconstruction of specific themes (e.g. migration, or care and treatment).</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p><em>Isotope and Biomolecular Archaeology </em>in which you will develop skills and understanding in isotope and DNA analysis. These techniques are of increasing importance in the study of human skeletal remains.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p><em>Research Topic in Archaeology, </em>in which you can undertake a more in-depth study of a particular period or place of interest. In the Department of Archaeology we have expertise in a wide range of time periods and over a large geographical range. </p>
<h3>Term 3</h3>
<p>The research skills acquired earlier in the course will be developed further through the dissertation research project. Under the supervision of a member of academic staff you will undertake a detailed study of a particular area of interest, resulting in a significant piece of independent research. The dissertation is regarded as preparation for further professional or academic work.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, you will have access to an “academic adviser”, who will provide you with academic support and guidance. All members of teaching staff have weekly office hours when they are available to meet on a ‘drop-in’ basis, but the Department’s teaching staff are renowned for being friendly, approachable and helpful should you have queries at any time. The department also has an exciting programme of weekly one-hour research seminars which you are strongly encouraged to attend.</p>

Many of the modules cover quite large topics or long periods; these are intended to introduce you to subjects which may be unfamiliar and which pose new questions and new problems, showing you how wide the study of history really is.</p>,<p>You will take ‘Making History’ which will enable you to develop more advanced study skills through working in a small, intensive seminar. These require extensive reading, discussion, and writing about problems of historical interpretation in a defined area, and will focus on both primary and secondary sources. The module is divided into different strands from which you will make your choice.</p>,<p>In addition, you will choose five further modules from a list of approximately 12. You <strong>must</strong> choose at least one Medieval, one Early Modern, and one Late Modern module. Typically, you will have one weekly lecture and a small-group seminar every two or three weeks. For the seminar, you will be given reading to do in advance, and on the basis of this you and the other students in your group will discuss particular issues. Students are expected to lead the discussion in seminars. Most modules are assessed by coursework essays and by a two-hour examination in May/June, in which you write answers to two essay-style questions.</p>,<p>The modules on offer change each year, as they reflect the research interests of staff; we cannot guarantee in advance that a particular module will be running in any particular year. This is a list of some of the modules that were available in 2019/20, to give you examples of the range of different themes we cover in the first year:</p>,<ul>
<li>Modern Times: a Cultural History of Europe, c. 1860-1960</li>
<li>Reformation Europe</li>
<li>The Rise and Fall of American Slavery, 1607-1865</li>
<li>The Birth of Western Society, 300-1050 AD</li>
<li>The Making of Modern Africa: Change and Adaptation in sub-Saharan Africa.</li>
</ul>,<h2>Year 2</h2>,<p>In the second year, you will study five modules. One of these, ‘Conversations with History’, is a double-module which is taught through student-led seminars. It develops your understanding of issues of historiography, provides an introduction to the writing of more extended historical argument, and prepares you for the final year Dissertation. This is an important feature of our course, and so all Single Honours students will take it. It is divided into different strands covering different topics from which you will make your choice.</p>,<p>Alongside ‘Conversations’, students take four further modules. These are taught intensively over half of the academic year. There are many other departments in the University, of course, and you may take modules from other departments as well – but you may not take more than 40 credits (normally the equivalent of two modules) across your second and third years. As in the first year, our focus on research-led teaching means that the modules on offer will vary year by year.</p>,<p>This list gives you an idea of example modules:</p>,<ul>
<li>Conversations Strands: The End of the Roman Empire; Slavery in Modern Africa; Discipline and Modernity</li>
<li>Treasure of Heaven: Medieval Monasticism</li>
<li>Political Culture in Japan since 1688</li>
<li>Gender and Sexuality During Britain’s Long Twentieth Century.</li>
</ul>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The BA (Hons) History degree is directed towards acquisition of a high standard of skills in research, analysis and expression, both written and oral. As a student on the course, you will receive an average of 6.5 hours of timetabled contact per week over the course of the degree. This will include a combination of lectures, seminars, and tutorials. The balance between these activities will change over the course of the degree as you develop your knowledge and abilities as an independent learner.</p>
<p>Timetabled contact is only the beginning of your learning. It provides a starting-point for your development as an independent, self-motivated learner. In the first year, you will spend around 75% of your term-time working hours in independent research; by the final year, this will rise to around 90%. As the QAA History Subject Benchmark statement makes clear (sec 6.6): ‘Most of a history student’s time is spent working independently, reading, thinking and writing’.</p>
<p>In the <strong>first year</strong>, you will receive around 8.5 hours of timetabled contact each week. The six modules provide an induction into the discipline of advanced historical study. They offer engagement with different periods and approaches to the study of the past, and experience of the way in which History, as a community of practice, encompasses the diversity of the human experience. Lectures introduce broad historical questions and offer contextualisation and critical commentary; seminars provide an opportunity for you to develop your critical skills through discussion for which you will have prepared in advance. A resource package for each module, provided through the online learning environment and as a physical handbook, will guide your independent research. You will also attend sessions on study skills, tailored to the discipline, covering library resources, note-taking, seminar work and essay writing.</p>
<p>In the <strong>second year</strong>, there is an increased emphasis on the development of critical and analytical skills. The curriculum continues to require you to engage with a range of periods and styles of historical study, with modules introducing new problems in a more specific framework. One compulsory module develops the induction into the community of practice through progression to a research-led seminar-based learning style. In view of the increased role of smaller-group work, which requires more independent preparation by students, the average timetabled contact time in Year 2 is 7.5 hours per week.</p>
<p>In the <strong>third year </strong>you will be expected to take further responsibility for managing your own time. The curriculum, while continuing to offer support and guidance, will require you to use the skills in independent study and time management which you have developed in the two preceding years. The Dissertation, in particular, requires you to establish your own research agenda and identify primary historical sources and extended reading lists, giving you the opportunity to engage, at an advanced level, with creative cutting-edge research at the forefront of the discipline. In your Special Subject you will be involved in a seminar group which meets each week to discuss the interpretation of chosen primary sources and to interrogate the secondary literature. You will be expected to spend at least 35 hours each week in independent research, and for this reason timetabled contact is limited to an average of 4.5 hours each week.</p>
<p>Throughout the degree you will also benefit from the ready accessibility of staff, who will respond to emails within two working days, and each of whom sets aside two hours each week in which students may drop in to see them. This un-timetabled one-to-one contact usually focuses on a specific issue of analysis or argument and gives students a strong sense of personal engagement with learning. You will be encouraged to attend the Department’s extensive programme of research-related activities, including its research seminar series, and public lectures from high-profile guest speakers and other events organised by the student-run History Society. In addition to this, you will be invited to attend regular events organised jointly by the department and the Careers and Enterprise Centre.</p>

<p>Our curriculum places a strong emphasis on inquiry-based learning, with a particular focus on carrying out field-based research. At the start of your second year, you will visit one of our residential field schools to carry out project work, and put your emerging qualitative and quantitative research skills into practice.</p>
<p>The Anthropology Department also has anthropometric equipment, a skeletal collection, a fossil cast collection, a material culture collection and other practical resources that are used in relevant modules, and you may also be able to use these independently, to supplement your learning or for project work. As you move through your BSc (Hons) Health and Human Sciences course, you will shift from being a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. To help develop this independence, you will spend part of your time engaged in self-directed study, which will include reading, project work and preparation for classes. In your third year, you will undertake a dissertation on an anthropological topic of your choice, giving you the chance to engage in a major piece of independent work.</p>
<p>Assessment on the BSc (Hons) Health and Human Sciences degree varies by module but may include written examinations, coursework in the form of essays or research projects, and presentations. </p>
<p>You will be given a Year Group Tutor when you start your degree, and will normally keep the same tutor for the duration of your studies. Year Group Tutors are there to support your academic work by providing advice about such things as study skills, module choices, dissertation topics, and applications for further study or employment. As well as discussing your academic work with your tutor, you are encouraged to make use of the Feedback and Consultation hours provided by academic staff during term-time. These Feedback and Consultation hours give you the opportunity to discuss your work with module tutors, for example to seek clarification on complex ideas, get suggestions for additional readings, and receive further feedback on assessments. As a student in the Anthropology Department, you will be welcomed into the wider departmental community and can attend an extensive programme of research-focused departmental and research group seminars where academic staff, postgraduate students and visiting scholars present their cutting-edge research, which may provide inspiration for your dissertation topic and even future study or employment. </p>

On this course you will receive theoretical and practical training for understanding and quantifying risks and hazards. You will also learn about how hazards persist over long periods of time instead of merely as single events, but are composed of many smaller sub-events or how their effects are widespread.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>Understanding and managing risk is ultimately about choice. All elements of society, from individuals to governments, must make decisions – conscious or not – about the ways in which they perceive, interpret, balance, and mitigate risk. Risk permeates our day-to-day lives in ways that are now recognised to be much more complex than the hazard-vulnerability paradigm, which dominated risk research until the 1990s, recognised. A deeper understanding of the nature of risk, its emergence, and its interface and position within societies, has emphasised the need to take a much more complex view in which a general understanding of the ways in which risk is generated, experienced and managed needs to be combined with a specific understanding of particular science or policy areas.</p>
<p>The primary aim of this Masters degree is to equip you with a general understanding of risk, whilst simultaneously providing specific training in science-based elements of risk-related research. This will be achieved through an interdisciplinary framework for understanding risk from a variety of perspectives. You will learn theoretical and practical approaches to identifying and framing risk, as well as the underlying physical and social mechanisms that generate it. You will also examine the relationship of risk to knowledge and policy, and be made aware of the array of advanced tools and techniques to assess the physical and social dimensions of risk under conditions of uncertainty. You will also be trained in the substance and methods associated with a range of science and policy areas, and be expected to demonstrate that you can combine your general training in risk with your specific understanding of the substance and method associated with the chosen area, through either a research-based or a vocational dissertation. Through a combination of core and elective modules, the MA offers two unique pathways for the development of practical skills associated to risk analysis:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Environmental Hazards and Resilience</em></strong>: This pathway provides specialised scientific training in environmental hazards that pose large risks to communities living throughout the world — such as earthquakes, flooding events, landslides and many others. Students will receive theoretical and practical training for understanding, quantifying and/or critically evaluating environmental hazards and the relationship of these with issues of vulnerability and resilience. They will learn about how environmental hazards and risks persist over long periods of time instead of merely as single events, and are made up of both natural processes as well as socio-economic dynamics. Its main modules are ‘Spatial and Temporal Dimensions of Hazards’ and  ‘Hydro-meteorological Hazards’.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Climate Risk and Society:</em></strong> A new pathway within the Risk Masters, developed in response to student demand and the need to support our graduates in addressing the most relevant societal challenges of today. It seeks to provide students with an advanced understanding of anthropogenic climate change as an issue that poses new challenges, risks and vulnerabilities to society. It also supports students in developing tools for apprehending, interpreting and responding to the emerging natural and socio-political threats associated to climate change. The <em>Climate Risk and Society</em> pathway provokes students to think critically about how evolving understandings of risk, resilience and vulnerability shape efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The pathway’s main module is ‘Climate Risk and Society’.    </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The Risk Masters (both in its MA and MSc forms) is taught jointly between Durham University’s Geography Department, the School of Government &amp; International Affairs, and the School of Applied Social Sciences. The course’s interdisciplinary approach encourages you to combine science and social science perspectives. You have a broad range of modules to choose from, and in this way develop an individualized set of professional skills that, depending on the student’s preferences, speak more to either the natural sciences (e.g. via scientific modelling, GIS or science and communication) or the social sciences (e.g. via social science research methodologies and engagements with social policy and international relations). The course is delivered in close collaboration with Durham University’s Institute of Hazard, Risk and Resilience (IHRR), and through IHRR’s activities students get permanent exposure to both practitioner and academic perspectives at the forefront of risk thinking and practice.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>Understanding and managing risk is ultimately about choice. All elements of society, from individuals to governments, must make decisions – conscious or not – about the ways in which they perceive, interpret, balance, and mitigate risk. Risk permeates our day-to-day lives in ways that are now recognised to be much more complex than the hazard-vulnerability paradigm, which dominated risk research until the 1990s, recognised. A deeper understanding of the nature of risk, its emergence, and its interface and position within societies, has emphasised the need to take a much more complex view in which a general understanding of the ways in which risk is generated, experienced and managed needs to be combined with a specific understanding of particular science or policy areas.</p>
<p>The primary aim of this Masters is to equip you with a general understanding of risk and resilience, whilst simultaneously providing specific training in elements of risk-related research. The MA supports you in developing a strong social science perspective on risk, while also maintaining an interdisciplinary outlook. You will learn theoretical and practical approaches to identifying and framing risk, as well as the underlying physical and social mechanisms that generate it. You will also examine the relationship of risk to knowledge and policy, and made aware of the array of advanced tools and techniques to assess the physical and social dimensions of risk under conditions of uncertainty. Through a combination of core and elective modules, the MA offers three unique pathways for the development of practical skills associated to risk analysis:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Security and Politics</em></strong>: This pathway is aimed at students interested in security-related risk, offering advanced skills in the critical analysis of issues such as risk and migration, risk within geo-politics, security and terrorism. The pathway critically unpacks ideas of risk and resilience, pointing to their political implications. It evaluates the ways by which uncertainty plays a key role in the contemporary making of society, and uncovers risk not simply as a matter of management and governance but also as a political technique through which populations are governed. The pathway’s main module is ‘Social Dimensions of Risk and Resilience’, alongside a range of modules in the fields of international relations and social policy. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Environmental Hazards and Resilience</em></strong>: This pathway provides specialised scientific training in environmental hazards that pose large risks to communities living throughout the world — such as earthquakes, flooding events, landslides and many others. Students will receive theoretical and practical training for understanding, quantifying and/or critically evaluating environmental hazards and the relationship of these with issues of vulnerability and resilience. They will learn about how environmental hazards and risks persist over long periods of time instead of merely as single events, and are made up of both natural processes as well as socio-economic dynamics. Its main modules are ‘Spatial and Temporal Dimensions of Hazards’ and  ‘Hydro-meteorological Hazards’.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Climate Risk and Society:</em></strong> A new pathway within the Risk Masters, developed in response to student demand and the need to support our graduates in addressing the most relevant societal challenges of today. It seeks to provide students with an advanced understanding of anthropogenic climate change as an issue that poses new challenges, risks and vulnerabilities to society. It also supports students in developing tools for apprehending, interpreting and responding to the emerging natural and socio-political threats associated to climate change. The <em>Climate Risk and Society</em> pathway provokes students to think critically about how evolving understandings of risk, resilience and vulnerability shape efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The pathway’s main module is ‘Climate Risk and Society’.    </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The Risk Masters (both in its MA and MSc forms) is taught jointly between Durham University’s Geography Department, the School of Government &amp; International Affairs, and the Department of Sociology. The course’s interdisciplinary approach encourages you to combine science and social science perspectives. You will have a broad range of modules to choose from, and in this way develop an individualized set of professional skills that, depending on your preferences, speak more to either the natural sciences (e.g. via scientific modelling, GIS or science and communication) or the social sciences (e.g. via social science research methodologies and engagements with social policy and international relations). The course is delivered in close collaboration with Durham University’s Institute of Hazard, Risk and Resilience (IHRR), and through IHRR’s activities students get permanent exposure to both practitioner and academic perspectives at the forefront of risk thinking and practice.</p>

These subjects are divided into three groups:</p>,<h3>Group 1</h3>,<ul>
<li>Biology</li>
<li>Chemistry</li>
<li>Computer Science</li>
<li>Earth Sciences</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Physics</li>
<li>Psychology.</li>
</ul>,<p>At least half of your studies in the second and third years in Natural Sciences must be from the subjects listed in Group 1. Not all subjects can be taken together.</p>,<h3>Group 2</h3>,<ul>
<li>Anthropology</li>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Economics</li>
<li>Geography</li>
<li>Philosophy.</li>
</ul>,<p><strong>No more than half</strong> of your studies in the second and third years can be from subjects in Group 2. Each of these subjects contributes to at least one Joint Honours degree with the subjects from Group 1.</p>,<h3>Group 3</h3>,<p>These subjects are Sport and Education (excluding History of Art) and are based in Durham City. None of the subjects in Group 3 contribute to a Joint Honours degree in Natural Sciences (and so no combination with these subjects is guaranteed to work in the timetable) and no more than half of your studies in the second and third years can be made up of subjects in Groups 2 and 3. If you are interested in taking subjects from Group 3, you are strongly recommended to contact the Natural Sciences Admissions Selector to judge on the feasibility of combining subjects from Groups 1 and 3.</p>,<p>Typically, first-year BSc Natural Sciences students either take three modules from two subjects or modules from three subjects. Other combinations are possible, but this combination would normally allow you to progress with any or all three of these subjects, as well as starting some new subjects in your second year.</p>,<h3>Flexibility and choice</h3>,<p>The degree allows you to choose from a wide choice of subjects to include in your degree. It also allows you to delay the choice about the direction of your studies until the end of your first year (and in some cases to the end of your second year). Each year you can normally change your choice of modules within the first three weeks of the academic year.</p>,<h3>Depth</h3>,<p>The degree requires final-year students to undertake capstone modules which are student driven and involve independent thought, personal management of the work’s direction and are reflective of the degree's learning outcomes. Typically, these modules will have a very small taught component and staff act as mentors, rather than deliverers of information.</p>,<h3>Patterns of study</h3>,<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>,<h2>BSc (Honours) Natural Sciences </h2>,<p>With this route you could study the same three subjects each year. You could also build on your first-year studies in one or two subjects and then combine advanced modules in these subjects with a new subject(s) in your second year.</p>,<p>You could then study two or three subjects in your third year, all of which you must also have studied in earlier years. With this route you would graduate with a BSc (Hons) degree in Natural Sciences with your main subjects studied listed on the degree certificate.</p>,<p>At the end of Year 2, the BSc allows you the option of transferring onto either “with Year Abroad” or “with Placement” pathway.  Note that these options are competitive and so applicants cannot apply for these pathways through UCAS.</p>,<h2>BSc Joint Honours Degrees within Natural Sciences</h2>,<p>With a BSc Joint Honours degree in two subjects, you will study each of these two subjects in all of the three years of study. In the first year, there may be the opportunity to take modules in a third subject, if you wish. If you follow the requirements for a Joint Honours degree you graduate with a BSc Honours degree in A and B within the Natural Sciences degree (where A and B are replaced with the relevant subjects).  If a combination is not offered, it might still be possible for you to combine them with a third subject within a Natural Sciences degree that is not a Joint Honours degree. Please contact the Natural Sciences Admissions Selector for further details.  Note that the “with Year Abroad” and “with Placement” pathways are also offered as added extras with Joint Honours degrees. </p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>You must study at least two subjects, but no more than four, which give you a good progression into your second year subjects. You can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject.</p>,<h4>For instance, students who want to do the BSc Joint Honours degree in:</h4>,<ul>
<li>Biology and Earth Sciences must do four core modules, which leaves them free to choose any two optional modules from any subject on offer.</li>
<li>Economics and Mathematics must do five core modules from these subjects leaving them one free module from any subject.</li>
</ul>,<p>To find out the number of core modules for each subject you are advised to look at the <a href=""https://www.dur.ac.uk/natural.sciences/"">Natural Sciences webpages</a> as a guide.</p>,<p>BSc Natural Sciences students often take two modules from three subjects, although other combinations are possible, but this combination would normally allow progression with any or all three of these subjects. The design of the course is constrained by the entry requirements and limits of the University’s academic timetable which is published five months before the start of the academic year.</p>,<h2>Year 2</h2>,<p>You must study at least two subjects, but no more than three, which gives you reasonable progression into your third-year subjects. You can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject.</p>,<h4>For instance, students following the BSc Joint Honours degree in:</h4>,<ul>
<li>Mathematics and Physics must do five core modules leaving them free to choose another module from these subjects to achieve an equal balance.</li>
<li>Biology and Psychology must do six core modules.</li>
</ul>,<p>Students who are taking the BSc in Natural Sciences have considerable freedom which is only limited by progression and the academic timetable, so in this scenario they do not need to adhere to the strict Joint Honours rules. They must build on one or two subjects studied in their first year, but also have the option of starting a new subject by taking a first-year module in their second year.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The key characteristics of the Natural Sciences degree at Durham are choice, flexibility and depth. The Natural Sciences degree has a wide choice of subjects and in later years there is choice between modules within subjects. It is also a flexible degree and with most subjects you can delay choosing your subjects until you get to Durham and you can also change the shape of your degree at the end of the first year.</p>
<p><strong>The Natural Sciences degree has the following features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The degree is based at the Durham campus.</li>
<li>The University operates on a system of undergraduates studying 120 credits each year. There are 20, 40 and a few 60 credit modules, so students choose combinations of modules which add up to precisely 120 credits.</li>
<li>There are two types of degree that you can obtain, a 3-year BSc (degree code CFG0) or a 4-year MSci (degree code FGC0). Both the BSc and the MSci contain BSc Joint Honours and MSci Joint Honours degrees as well as the more broad BSc Natural Sciences and MSci Natural Sciences degrees.</li>
<li>You should note that not all combinations of all modules in all subjects are feasible. Choices are constrained by the limits of the University timetable, which changes every year.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>
<ul>
<li>a BSc Natural Sciences degree in which you study two or more subjects and start a new subject in your second year or carry on with the three subjects you have studied in your first year.</li>
<li>a Joint Honours BSc degree within Natural Sciences which involves studying the same two subjects in each of the three years (it is usually possible to study three or even four subjects in the first year).</li>
<li>take a Year Abroad in between the second and third years.</li>
<li>do a placement in between the second and third years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students on the Natural Sciences course design their own programme, so depending on their choices they learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical classes, fieldwork, informal but scheduled one-on-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing. All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO).</p>
<p>Tutorials, seminars, workshops, and practical classes are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow one-to-one interaction with a member of staff. Practicals also allow hands-on experience of the work of professionals in the disciplines studied on the course. The same is true of fieldwork and consists of engaging in, for example, geological, biological, geographical, or anthropological work in the field with members of academic staff. This emphasis on small-group and practical teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions.</p>
<p>The degrees in Natural Sciences are designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year. Small-group teaching and one-to-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the course) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a major project. In this way the degree systematically transforms the student from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the degree. Students can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars in various academic departments present their cutting-edge research.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>At the beginning of the academic year, you will go through five-day induction events in which you are informed about University, the School, the MA/MSc degrees and the facilities available for their learning.</p>
<p>The 180 credits one-year MA degree is divided into two core and two optional modules of 30 credits each. Furthermore, you will have to submit a dissertation of 60 credits of not more than 12,000 words. Most of the modules are delivered during the first two terms and you will spend the remaining time writing your dissertation.</p>
<p>PGT modules involve a range of different modes of delivery, but are largely based around lectures, seminars and other forms of active learning activities. The School places great importance on research-led teaching, which integrates new and cutting-edge research into the curriculum. Each module is build around 300 hours of learning, a large portion of which is independent reading and preparation. Class contact hours are all above 20 hours per module, with the exception of the dissertation, and are spread across the 12 teaching weeks in the academic calendar.  Typically modules would have elements of lectures, discussions, and presentations or other activities — the extent of each of these components would differ from one module to another.</p>
<p>All modules include a formative assessment to help you prepare for summative assignments by allowing you to identify what aspects of your work you are doing well on and which areas require improvement. You are encouraged to make appointments with the course lecturers to discuss module content, and after you have received it, any feedback on your work.</p>
<p>Typically summative assessments are around 3000 words, but these vary based on learning outcomes, assessment type, and module design. Some modules may be assessed by examination. The majority of coursework involves independent reading and written assignments, but you will have the opportunity to discuss course material as well either through presentations or class discussions.  You will be assigned a dissertation supervisor, who will also act as your academic advisor, and is someone you can consult throughout the year for general academic support, in addition to dissertation supervision.</p>
<p>SGIA conducts regular seminars and organises lectures throughout the year which all postgraduate students can attend. These events provide opportunities to engage with, and debate, the most important issues in current political and international studies.</p>

The course lasts for one year full-time (two years part-time).</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The MA in Greece, Rome and the Near East is principally conceived as a research training course, which aims to build on the skills in independent learning acquired in the course of the student’s first degree and enable them to undertake fully independent research at a higher level. Contact time with tutors for taught modules is typically a total of <strong>5 hours per week</strong> (rising to 7 for someone beginning Latin or ancient Greek at this level), with an emphasis on small group teaching, and a structure that maximises the value of this time, and best encourages and focuses the student’s own independent study and preparation. On average, around <strong>2 hours a week</strong> of other relevant academic contact (research seminars, dissertation supervision) is also available.</p>
<p>At the heart of the course is the Dissertation module, in which students write a 15,000 word dissertation of a research topic of their own devising. Core research training and support for students’ dissertation research is provided through the Dissertation seminars. These are weekly classes which in the first term introduce the range of <strong>research methods</strong> <strong>and resources</strong> available to someone working in the field of Classics, and over the year build the research skills needed for the dissertation. The classes comprise a mixture of lectures, student-led discussions and student presentations, and are tailored to the individual research interests of each cohort. In addition, students are matched with an individual Dissertation supervisor, who will be an expert in their field of interest, and from whom they will receive an additional five hours of individual dissertation supervision over the year.</p>
<p>In addition to the Dissertation, students select <strong>three or four further optional modules</strong> dealing with particular specialised subjects. At least one of these must involve work with a relevant language (ancient or modern), and at least one must deal directly with research on interaction between the ancient Mediterranean and the ancient Near East.</p>
<p>We offer tuition in Greek and Latin at all levels, including Beginners classes for those with no previous experience in the subject, and advanced Greek and Latin Text Seminars for those with degree-level knowledge. Other ancient languages on offer at Durham include Akkadian, Hebrew and Aramaic; modern languages include German, French and Italian (there are usually specialised reading skills courses in these languages, designed to meet the needs of postgraduates who wish to use them for research).</p>
<p>All the optional modules offered at Durham are research-led, i.e. they will form part of the current research activity of the tutor taking the module. Numbers for each module are typically very small (often no more than five or six in a class). Typically, classes are two hours long and held fortnightly, and discussion is based on student presentations. (Modules for those beginning ancient Latin or Greek are typically more heavily subscribed, but their classes also meet more often: 3 hours per week.)</p>
<p>In exceptional cases, students with a particular research training need which matches Departmental expertise but is not covered by the taught provision in our or other Departments in any given year may also make a proposal to take an <strong>Independent Research Topic</strong> in place of one taught MA module. For an IRT, students produce an independent piece of research with an individual member of staff (usually a 5000-word commentary or extended essay), receiving 5 hours of supervision. (Nb. There can be no overlap between the IRT and the Dissertation, and students must demonstrate on entry that they have the required expertise, and need, for project work in the relevant area).</p>
<p>All staff teaching on the MA are available for consultation by students, and run weekly office hours in addition to formal contact time. The MA Director acts as Academic Adviser to MA students, and is available as an additional point of contact, especially for matters concerning academic progress.</p>
<p>In addition to the formal part of the course, the Department has a very vibrant culture of research seminars and talks. In particular, MA students are strongly encouraged to attend the Department’s two research seminar series. Although not a formal (assessed) part of the MA, engagement with these seminars across a range of subjects is part of students’ development as researchers and ought to be viewed as essential to their course. In addition, MA students are welcome to attend and present at the ‘Junior Work-in-Progress’ seminar series organised by the PhD students in the Department. Finally, our student-run Classics Society regularly organises guest speakers – often very high-profile scholars from outside Durham.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>This course is mainly delivered through a mixture of lectures, practical classes and fieldwork. Typically lectures provide key information on a particular area and identify the main areas for discussion and debate. Practical classes and fieldwork allows you to gain direct experience of practical and interpretative skills in Earth Science. Tutorials then provide the opportunity for smaller groups to discuss and debate particular issues or areas, based on the knowledge that you have gained through your lectures and independent study outside the courses formal contact hours.</p>
<p>The balance of these types of activities changes over the course of the degree, as you develop your knowledge and your abilities as an independent learner.  This is one of the key attributes you will develop (thereby preparing you for work or further study once you have completed the course). In the first year you will typically attend six hours a week of lectures, and 12 hours of practical classes. You are also required to attend six tutorial sessions during the academic year. Outside timetabled contact hours, you are also expected to undertake your own independent study to prepare for your classes and broaden your subject knowledge. You may opt to participate in a one-week field trip to the Lake District during the Easter vacation of your first year.</p>
<p>The balance starts to shift in the second year, as you develop your abilities as an independent learner. Lectures still play an important role in supporting you in developing your knowledge and skills, with an average of six hours a week, and you will participate in six, two-hour practical classes per week across the academic year that both introduce you to, and give you the chance to practice geological research methods. There are no compulsory field courses within this degree route, however, they are optional.</p>
<p>This move towards greater emphasis on independent learning continues in the final year. You have the option to carry out a dissertation. You will be assigned a tutor appropriate for your dissertation. Support for your dissertation will take the form of one-to-one tutorial sessions. This provides you with the opportunity to engage with academic issues at the forefront of Earth Science research, in a learning environment that is very much focused on discussion and debate of these issues. This places a premium on preparing effectively for classes.</p>
<p>This emphasis on using independent study and research skills that you developed in earlier years is continued through the dissertation that you will undertake. Under the supervision of a member of academic staff you will typically have three or four one-to-one supervisory meetings, you will undertake a detailed study of a particular area resulting in a significant piece of independent research. At Level 3 you have the option to attend a one-week field trip to Cyprus, and there is the optional module which requires you to attend a field trip to Tenerife.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, you also have access to an academic tutor who will provide you with academic support and guidance. Typically you will meet with your tutor six times a year, in addition to which all members of teaching staff have an open door policy and are available to meet on a ‘drop-in’ basis. The Department also has an exciting programme of weekly one-hour research seminars which you are strongly encouraged to attend, and there is a seminar programme run throughout the year by the student-led Arthur Holmes Society.</p>

Geophysics has many practical applications and forms an essential part of the economic exploitation of hydrocarbon and mineral resources. Geophysicists are also involved with assessing and mitigating natural hazards such as earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis.</p>,<p>The Geophysics with Geology degree shows progression from the first year through to the third year. In the first year, you share the compulsory modules with the other degree courses, but it also includes additional compulsory modules which specialise in Mathematics and Physics. In the second and third years, you deal with material that is specialist, numerically based and at the cutting-edge of geophysical research.</p>,<p>Graduates from this degree have secured employment across the geoscience sector, within the mineral exploration and extraction industries, in petroleum exploration companies, and with environmental and hydro-geological industries. The advanced quantitative skills developed during this course can provide a strong base for securing employment outside geoscience, for example, in finance, insurance and banking.</p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<h3>Compulsory modules:</h3>,<ul>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>This course is mainly delivered through a mixture of lectures, practical classes, tutorials and fieldwork. Typically lectures provide key information on a particular area, and identify the main areas for discussion and debate. Practical classes and fieldwork allow you to gain direct experience of practical and interpretative skills in Geophysics. Tutorials provide opportunities for smaller groups to discuss and debate particular issues or areas, based on the knowledge that you have gained through your lectures and practical classes.</p>
<p>The balance of these types of activities changes over the course of the degree, as you develop your knowledge and your abilities as an independent learner. This is one of the key attributes that you will develop (thereby preparing you for work or further study once you have completed the course).</p>
<p>In the first year you will typically attend six hours a week of lectures, and 12 hours of practical classes. You are also required to attend six tutorial sessions during the academic year. Outside timetabled contact hours, you are also expected to undertake your own independent study to prepare for your classes and broaden your subject knowledge. It is expected that you will attend a week-long field course in the Lake District during the Easter vacation.</p>
<p>The balance starts to shift in the second year, as you develop your abilities as an independent learner. Lectures still play an important role in supporting you in developing your knowledge and skills, with an average of six hours a week, and you will participate in six, two-hour practical classes per week across the academic year that introduce you to, and give you the chance to practice geophysical research methods. You are required to attend a one-week geophysics field course.</p>
<p>This move towards independent learning continues in your final year. You are required to carry out a dissertation. You will be assigned a tutor appropriate to your dissertation. Support for your dissertation will take the form of one-to-one tutorial sessions. This provides you with the opportunity to engage with academic issues at the forefront of geophysical research, in a learning environment that is very much focused on discussion and debate of these issues. This places a premium on preparing effectively for classes.</p>
<p>This emphasis on using independent study and research skills developed in earlier years is continued through your dissertation. Under the supervision of a member of academic staff with who you will typically have three or four one-to-one supervisory meetings, you will undertake a detailed study of a particular area resulting in a significant piece of independent research. At Level 3 you will have the option to attend a one-week field trip to Cyprus, and there is the optional module which requires you to attend a field trip to Tenerife.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, you will have access to an academic tutor who will provide you with academic support and guidance. Typically you will meet with your tutor six times a year, in addition to which all members of teaching staff have an open door policy and available to meet with you on a ‘drop-in’ basis. The Department also has an exciting programme of weekly one-hour research seminars which you are strongly encouraged to attend, there is also a seminar programme run throughout the year by the student-led Arthur Holmes Society.</p>

The degree enables you to acquire a critical understanding of theories, empirical evidence and practical application whilst maintaining a rigorous academic underpinning. In particular, you will learn about corporate finance, investments, financial institutions and the vast array of sophisticated financial products traded in today’s global financial markets. Furthermore, you will develop the quantitative techniques needed to analyse, in depth, financial data and financial securities.</p>,<p>Flexibility – subject to optional module choice and successful completion of your first year – it may be possible to change your degree path to either Accounting and Finance or Accounting and Management. (if you require a Tier 4 visa will need to check in advance with the Tier 4 regulations which are in place at the time).</p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>In the first year, you will study five compulsory modules that provide the key fundamentals to examine and evaluate modern financial markets, including introductions to financial and management accounting, economics, finance and mathematics and statistics. These will be complimented by an optional module from the areas of business, global economics or foreign languages.</p>,<h2>Year 2</h2>,<p>In the second year, you will study three compulsory finance modules to allow you to be able to examine financial issues and the institutions, markets and securities that facilitate the vast array of financial transactions that occur continuously across global markets. Furthermore, you will acquire numerous quantitative tools which enable you to interpret financial data and price financial securities. The finance modules are complemented by two compulsory economics modules – macro and microeconomics – and an optional module from the areas of law, accounting, tax or foreign languages.</p>,<h2>Year 3</h2>,<p>In an increasingly globalised world, a period of international study is a major benefit and can help you to stand out in a crowded job market. All of our business degrees offer you the option of spending your third year studying abroad at one of our international partner universities. This is an opportunity to develop foreign language skills, experience another country and learn about its culture as well as adding an international dimension to your overall employability.</p>,<p>You may decide to study at one of our exchange universities for a full-year study placement period in your third year of study and this then becomes the third year of a four year degree.</p>,<p>Opportunities for study abroad have in the past included  Australia, Canada, Chile, China/Hong Kong, Columbia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Singapore, Spain, South Korea, Funding may be available through scholarships offered by the host institution, the British Council and/or other funding bodies.

All study abroad degrees are subject to approval by the Business School. Some partner relationships have restricted access and so are not available to everyone. The Business School, in association with the University, will assist you in applying for a study abroad place, but it is your responsibility to apply for a place and the right of the Business School/University to allocate you to available places as we deem best. In the event that you are unable to obtain a study abroad place, transfer to the equivalent ‘non-study abroad’ degree is guaranteed provided the you are eligible to transfer on academic grounds. In line with Home Office rules, if you are from outside the EU you will transfer onto the ‘with study abroad’ course only once you have successfully secured a placement (normally at the end of your second year of study).

<p>All of these are supported by a state-of-the-art virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO). Seminars and workshops are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow greater one-on-one interaction with teaching staff. Workshops also allow hands-on experience in solving finance related problems.</p>
<p>This emphasis on small-group teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of your learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions. In fact, the degree is designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as you move from your first to your final year.</p>
<p>Small-group teaching and one-on-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided at the start) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a dissertation – supported by one-on-one supervision – that makes up a third of final year credits.</p>
<p>In this way the degree gives you the opportunity to transform from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the course and continue at key times throughout.</p>
<p>You can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars present their cutting-edge research.</p>

The degree prepares you for a career in the financial environment by providing a technical curriculum to strengthen the link between academia and practice. The BSc Finance enables you to acquire a critical understanding of theories, empirical evidence and practical application whilst maintaining a rigorous academic underpinning. In particular, you will learn about corporate finance, investments, financial institutions and the vast array of sophisticated financial products traded in today’s global financial markets. Furthermore, you will develop the quantitative techniques needed to analyse, in-depth, financial data and financial securities.</p>,<p>Flexibility – subject to optional module choice and successful completion of your first year – it may be possible to change your degree path to either Accounting and Finance or Accounting and Management. (if you require a Tier 4 visa you will need to check this in advance with Tier 4 regulations in place at the time).</p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>In the first year, you will study five compulsory modules that provide the key fundamentals to examine and evaluate modern financial markets, including introductions to financial and management accounting, economics, finance and mathematics and statistics. These will be complemented by an optional module from the areas of business, global economics or foreign languages.</p>,<h2>Year 2</h2>,<p>In the second year, you will study three compulsory finance modules to allow you to be able to examine financial issues and the institutions, markets and securities that facilitate the vast array of financial transactions that occur continuously across global markets. Furthermore, you will acquire numerous quantitative tools which enable you to interpret financial data and price financial securities. The finance modules are complemented by one compulsory economics module – macro – and an optional module from the areas of law, accounting, tax or foreign languages.</p>,<h2>Year 3</h2>,<p>All of our degrees offer you the option of spending your third year gaining practical experience on a placement. Placement years are a great way to develop your employment marketability and to engage with employers early in their recruitment pipeline. A placement requires a minimum of 40 weeks of work experience and the placement begins in the summer following completion of the second year, and this then becomes the third year of a four-year degree programme. This allows you to really explore and understand your job and to find out if the career or company is for you.</p>,<ul>
<li>You will develop your practical skills, confidence and maturity.</li>
<li>You can focus on a specific career path – many employers recruit graduates from their placement programme.</li>
<li>You will be able to contextualise your studies better, be more mature in your attitude to work.</li>
<li>You may decide to draw on your working experiences and access a more fulfilling dissertation research subject.</li>
<li>You will gain invaluable job search and graduate research skills by engaging in the competitive placement recruitment process.</li>
</ul>,<p>To ensure you are getting the most out of your experience, we support your placement in a number of ways:</p>,<p><strong>First Year Workshops and Bootcamps </strong>to<strong> </strong>help you to develop your Placement Strategy and to identify and develop those skills and competencies that will be critical to ensure you are attractive to potential placement employers. These typically involve Employers, Placement Mentors and representatives from Colleges, Societies and the Volunteering Community in Durham.</p>,<p><strong>Second Year Workshops and Bootcamps </strong>support you through the placement application process and allow you to develop into a supportive student group to travel along the road of gaining a placement together. They enable you to get to know those students who will return with you in the fourth year. Workshops typically involve employers, and former placement students.</p>,<p><strong>The DUBS Placement Programme</strong> includes a series of employer-led events which take place throughout term 1 and 2 and is open to all first year and second year placement students. The skills sessions and networking events allow students to develop essential employability skills as well as providing valuable insight into the recruitment process.</p>,<p><strong>Placement Mentors: </strong>We have a mentorship scheme whereby former placement students share their experiences of the application process and placement with first and second year students and those out on placement. If you become a placement mentor on your return to University you can continue to develop your interpersonal skills and slide back into your University life with another key role which may well develop a new sense of belonging as well as another valuable contribution to your CV.</p>,<p><strong>Placement Tutors: </strong>Whilst you are on placement you are assigned an academic tutor who will visit you, liaise with your employer and ensure you gain the most from your experience.</p>,<p>The Placement Year fees are set annually by the University. For the definitive amount of the Placement Year tuition fee payable please contact our <a href=""mailto:business.placements@durham.ac.uk"">Placement Team</a>.</p>,<p>*The offer of a place on a ‘with Placement Year’ degree does not imply that Durham University Business School guarantees to find the student a placement. The Business School, in association with the University, will assist students in finding and applying for placements, but it is the responsibility of the student to apply for and to obtain a placement (which is subject to approval by the Business School). In the event that a student is unable to obtain a placement, transfer to the equivalent ‘non-placement’ programme is guaranteed provided the student is eligible to transfer on academic grounds. Due to visa requirements, we recommend that international students interested in the Placement Year as part of their degree apply for this programme when making their application to us via UCAS. This will prevent students having to change their visa in situ at University, and avoid the fee of a new visa.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>On this degree you will learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, workshops, informal but scheduled one-on-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing. All of these are supported by a state-of-the-art virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO).</p>
<p>Seminars and workshops are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow one-on-one interaction with teaching staff. Workshops also allow hands-on experience of solving business problems.</p>
<p>This emphasis on small-group teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions. In fact, the degree is designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as you move from your first to your final year.</p>
<p>Small-group teaching and one-on-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided at the start) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a dissertation – supported by one-on-one supervision – that makes up a third of final year credits.</p>
<p>In this way the degree systematically transforms you from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the course and continue at key times throughout each year of the programme.</p>
<p>Students can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars present their cutting-edge research.</p>

It is designed to produce graduates who will go on and lead engineering teams. Your first two years offer you a broad-based engineering education. You are then able to specialise in your third and fourth years.</p>,<p>At Durham in each year of your degree you will take six modules, the year is divided into three terms and there are examinations at the end of each year.</p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>You will study four modules in engineering, one in mathematics and one optional module. In your engineering modules, you will receive instruction in the use of 3D Computer Aided Design (CAD) software (e.g. SolidWorks), be taught how to implement engineering algorithms into computer code (specifically in C and MATLAB) and take part in a number of practical labs. You will also take part in a group design activity where you have to design, build and test a device to solve specific engineering challenge. Recent examples include miniature hydroelectric generators and chain-climbing robots. On the course, you also attend lectures, problem classes and supervisions with academic staff.</p>,<h3>Compulsory modules: </h3>,<ul>
<li>Solid Mechanics and Structures 1</li>
<li>Electronic and Electrical Systems 1</li>
<li>Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics 1</li>

<li>Mathematics for Engineers and Scientists</li>
</ul>,<p>And one free elective.</p>,<p>The optional (free elective) module may be selected from anything that will fit the timetable and for which you meet the necessary prerequisites. Popular choices in the past have included ‘Introduction to Programming’, ‘Computational Thinking’ and a range of different language modules, but some students have taken modules in History or Poetry.</p>,<h2>Year 2</h2>,<p>Engineering and mathematics now occupy the full six modules in the timetable.</p>,<p>You will undertake a major design project as part of a small team with guidance from an academic supervisor and an ‘Industrial Tutor’ (an engineer from industry). This lets you put into practice the skills and knowledge that you have developed in your lectures. The end result is a detailed design report and a series of CAD drawings good enough to manufacture a device from.</p>,<h3>Compulsory modules: </h3>,<ul>

<li>Engineering Design 2.</li>
</ul>,<h2>Year 3</h2>,<p>In the third year of the degree the course splits into the following streams: Civil, Electrical, Electronic and Mechanical Engineering.</p>,<p>A major team design project now occupies a whole module of the course where you consider the device as a product and do everything from basic market research to design for manufacture. For the Civil stream you will undertake a major design project supervised by practising civil engineers (plus an academic supervisor), which will allow you to develop new skills and knowledge in various areas, from bridge design to geotechnical structures. Practical skills, in addition to the weekly laboratory sessions, cover topics from land surveying to industrial problem solving with interaction with local industry, depending on the selected stream.</p>,<p>The modules for each stream comprise:</p>,<h3>Electrical Engineering Route</h3>,<h4>Compulsory modules: </h4>,<ul>
<li>Electrical Engineering 3</li>
<li>Power Semiconductor Devices 3</li>

<li>Solid Mechanics 3.</li>
</ul>,<p>In line with our integrated approach to engineering many of the modules taken in the third year are found in more than one stream.</p>,<h2>Year 4</h2>,<p>The highlight of the degree for many of our students is the final year project. This activity, which is half the year in most streams, involves working closely with an academic supervisor on an area of cutting-edge research and development. The best student projects have been featured in internationally recognised engineering journals, indicating that our students are amongst the finest young engineers in the world. In addition to this, you will take modules on advanced engineering topics.</p>,<p>The five final-year streams are Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Aeronautics, Electronic Engineering, and New and Renewable Energy. The modules for each stream are shown below, you will typically study six taught modules and the balance of work is project-based. Students on most streams can usually choose their sixth module from a list of options.</p>,<h3>Aeronautical</h3>,<h4>Compulsory modules: </h4>,<ul>

<li>Decarbonisation of Heating and Cooling 4.</li>
</ul>,<h3>Study Abroad</h3>,<p>Engineering is an increasingly international discipline and living and working in another country is a valuable addition to your CV. For this reason, students are encouraged to apply during their degree for a year-long placement with one of the Engineering Department's or the University's international partners, as an additional year of study. Students may study in English at some of the partner universities, whereas at others foreign language skills are essential. Students are fully supported by the Department both during the application process and during the year abroad. Language tuition is available in the first year in a range of languages as free elective modules and in other years through the University’s Languages For All scheme.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The course is mainly delivered through a mixture of lectures, problem classes, practical and design activities. Typically lectures provide key information on a particular field of study and identify the main underpinning engineering concepts in that area. Problem classes then provide opportunities for smaller groups to work through practical examples, based on the knowledge that you have gained through your lectures and through independent study outside the degrees formal contact hours. Finally, practical classes allow you to gain direct experience of practical and interpretative skills through laboratory classes, design activities and a Professional Engineering Applications Course (PEAC).</p>
<p>The balance of these types of activities changes as you develop your knowledge and your ability as an independent learner. This is one of the key attributes that you will develop (thereby preparing you for work or further study once you have completed the course). In the first two years, you will typically attend 12 hours a week of lectures (two hours per module) and have three hours of practical classes or design activities each week plus problem classes and small group supervision. In the first year there is a one-week full-time compulsory PEAC course and at the end of the second year there is a two-week full-time practical course. Outside timetabled contact hours, you are also expected to undertake your own independent study to prepare for your classes and broaden your subject knowledge.</p>
<p>The balance starts to shift in the third year, as you develop your abilities as an independent learner. Lectures still play an important role in supporting you in developing your knowledge and skills, with an average of 10 hours a week. The frequency of laboratory practical sessions and design activities remains similar, but the tasks become more open-ended.</p>
<p>This move towards greater emphasis on independent learning continues in the final year, where fewer modules comprise lectures, with an average of six hours a week. This emphasis on using the independent study and research skills developed in earlier years is continued through the research and development project that you will undertake. Under the supervision of a member of academic staff with who you will have weekly one-to-one supervisory meetings, you will undertake a detailed study of a particular area resulting in a significant piece of independent research.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, you also have access to an academic adviser who will provide you with academic support and guidance. You will meet regularly with your academic supervisor throughout your degree and they act as your first point-of-contact for any academic queries. In addition to this, all members of teaching staff have weekly tutorial hours when they are available to meet on a ‘sign-up’ basis. The Department also has an exciting programme of research seminars and talks from industrial companies which undergraduate students are strongly encouraged to attend.</p>

These subjects are divided into three groups:</p>,<h3>Group 1</h3>,<ul>
<li>Biology</li>
<li>Chemistry</li>
<li>Computer Science</li>
<li>Earth Sciences</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Physics</li>
<li>Psychology.</li>
</ul>,<p>At least half of your studies in the second and third years in Natural Sciences must be from the subjects listed in Group 1. Not all subjects can be taken together.</p>,<h3>Group 2</h3>,<ul>
<li>Anthropology</li>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Economics</li>
<li>Geography</li>
<li>Philosophy.</li>
</ul>,<p><strong>No more than half</strong> of your studies in the second and third years can be from subjects in Group 2. Each of these subjects contributes to at least one Joint Honours degree with the subjects from Group 1.</p>,<h3>Group 3</h3>,<p>These subjects are Sport and Education (excluding History of Art) and are based in Durham City. None of the subjects in Group 3 contribute to a Joint Honours degree in Natural Sciences (and so no combination with these subjects is guaranteed to work in the timetable) and no more than half of your studies in the second and third years can be made up of subjects in Groups 2 and 3. If you are interested in taking subjects from Group 3, you are strongly recommended to contact the Natural Sciences Admissions Selector to judge on the feasibility of combining subjects from Groups 1 and 3.</p>,<p>Typically, first-year BSc Natural Sciences students either take three modules from two subjects or modules from three subjects. Other combinations are possible, but this combination would normally allow you to progress with any or all three of these subjects, as well as starting some new subjects in your second year.</p>,<h3>Flexibility and choice</h3>,<p>The degree allows you to choose from a wide choice of subjects to include in your degree. It also allows you to delay the choice about the direction of your studies until the end of your first year (and in some cases to the end of your second year). Each year you can normally change your choice of modules within the first three weeks of the academic year.</p>,<h3>Depth</h3>,<p>The degree requires final-year students to undertake capstone modules which are student driven and involve independent thought, personal management of the work’s direction and are reflective of the degree's learning outcomes. Typically, these modules will have a very small taught component and staff act as mentors, rather than deliverers of information.</p>,<h3>Patterns of study</h3>,<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>,<h2>BSc (Honours) Natural Sciences </h2>,<p>With this route you could study the same three subjects each year. You could also build on your first-year studies in one or two subjects and then combine advanced modules in these subjects with a new subject(s) in your second year.</p>,<p>You could then study two or three subjects in your third year, all of which you must also have studied in earlier years. With this route you would graduate with a BSc (Hons) degree in Natural Sciences with your main subjects studied listed on the degree certificate.</p>,<p>At the end of Year 2, the BSc allows you the option of transferring onto either “with Year Abroad” or “with Placement” pathway.  Note that these options are competitive and so applicants cannot apply for these pathways through UCAS.</p>,<h2>BSc Joint Honours Degrees within Natural Sciences</h2>,<p>With a BSc Joint Honours degree in two subjects, you will study each of these two subjects in all of the three years of study. In the first year, there may be the opportunity to take modules in a third subject, if you wish. If you follow the requirements for a Joint Honours degree you graduate with a BSc Honours degree in A and B within the Natural Sciences degree (where A and B are replaced with the relevant subjects).  If a combination is not offered, it might still be possible for you to combine them with a third subject within a Natural Sciences degree that is not a Joint Honours degree. Please contact the Natural Sciences Admissions Selector for further details.  Note that the “with Year Abroad” and “with Placement” pathways are also offered as added extras with Joint Honours degrees. </p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>You must study at least two subjects, but no more than four, which give you a good progression into your second year subjects. You can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject.</p>,<h4>For instance, students who want to do the BSc Joint Honours degree in:</h4>,<ul>
<li>Biology and Earth Sciences must do four core modules, which leaves them free to choose any two optional modules from any subject on offer.</li>
<li>Economics and Mathematics must do five core modules from these subjects leaving them one free module from any subject.</li>
</ul>,<p>To find out the number of core modules for each subject you are advised to look at the <a href=""https://www.dur.ac.uk/natural.sciences/"">Natural Sciences webpages</a> as a guide.</p>,<p>BSc Natural Sciences students often take two modules from three subjects, although other combinations are possible, but this combination would normally allow progression with any or all three of these subjects. The design of the course is constrained by the entry requirements and limits of the University’s academic timetable which is published five months before the start of the academic year.</p>,<h2>Year 2</h2>,<p>You must study at least two subjects, but no more than three, which gives you reasonable progression into your third-year subjects. You can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject.</p>,<h4>For instance, students following the BSc Joint Honours degree in:</h4>,<ul>
<li>Mathematics and Physics must do five core modules leaving them free to choose another module from these subjects to achieve an equal balance.</li>
<li>Biology and Psychology must do six core modules.</li>
</ul>,<p>Students who are taking the BSc in Natural Sciences have considerable freedom which is only limited by progression and the academic timetable, so in this scenario they do not need to adhere to the strict Joint Honours rules. They must build on one or two subjects studied in their first year, but also have the option of starting a new subject by taking a first-year module in their second year.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The key characteristics of the Natural Sciences degree at Durham are choice, flexibility and depth. The Natural Sciences degree has a wide choice of subjects and in later years there is choice between modules within subjects. It is also a flexible degree and with most subjects you can delay choosing your subjects until you get to Durham and you can also change the shape of your degree at the end of the first year.</p>
<p><strong>The Natural Sciences degree has the following features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The degree is based at the Durham campus.</li>
<li>The University operates on a system of undergraduates studying 120 credits each year. There are 20, 40 and a few 60 credit modules, so students choose combinations of modules which add up to precisely 120 credits.</li>
<li>There are two types of degree that you can obtain, a 3-year BSc (degree code CFG0) or a 4-year MSci (degree code FGC0). Both the BSc and the MSci contain BSc Joint Honours and MSci Joint Honours degrees as well as the more broad BSc Natural Sciences and MSci Natural Sciences degrees.</li>
<li>You should note that not all combinations of all modules in all subjects are feasible. Choices are constrained by the limits of the University timetable, which changes every year.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>
<ul>
<li>a BSc Natural Sciences degree in which you study two or more subjects and start a new subject in your second year or carry on with the three subjects you have studied in your first year.</li>
<li>a Joint Honours BSc degree within Natural Sciences which involves studying the same two subjects in each of the three years (it is usually possible to study three or even four subjects in the first year).</li>
<li>take a Year Abroad in between the second and third years.</li>
<li>do a placement in between the second and third years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students on the Natural Sciences course design their own programme, so depending on their choices they learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical classes, fieldwork, informal but scheduled one-on-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing. All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO).</p>
<p>Tutorials, seminars, workshops, and practical classes are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow one-to-one interaction with a member of staff. Practicals also allow hands-on experience of the work of professionals in the disciplines studied on the course. The same is true of fieldwork and consists of engaging in, for example, geological, biological, geographical, or anthropological work in the field with members of academic staff. This emphasis on small-group and practical teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions.</p>
<p>The degrees in Natural Sciences are designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year. Small-group teaching and one-to-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the course) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a major project. In this way the degree systematically transforms the student from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the degree. Students can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars in various academic departments present their cutting-edge research.</p>

These subjects are divided into three groups:</p>,<h3>Group 1</h3>,<ul>
<li>Biology</li>
<li>Chemistry</li>
<li>Computer Science</li>
<li>Earth Sciences</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Physics</li>
<li>Psychology.</li>
</ul>,<p>At least half of your studies in the second and third years in Natural Sciences must be from the subjects listed in Group 1. Not all subjects can be taken together.</p>,<h3>Group 2</h3>,<ul>
<li>Anthropology</li>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Economics</li>
<li>Geography</li>
<li>Philosophy.</li>
</ul>,<p><strong>No more than half</strong> of your studies in the second and third years can be from subjects in Group 2. Each of these subjects contributes to at least one Joint Honours degree with the subjects from Group 1.</p>,<h3>Group 3</h3>,<p>These subjects are Sport and Education (excluding History of Art) and are based in Durham City. None of the subjects in Group 3 contribute to a Joint Honours degree in Natural Sciences (and so no combination with these subjects is guaranteed to work in the timetable) and no more than half of your studies in the second and third years can be made up of subjects in Groups 2 and 3. If you are interested in taking subjects from Group 3, you are strongly recommended to contact the Natural Sciences Admissions Selector to judge on the feasibility of combining subjects from Groups 1 and 3.</p>,<p>Typically, first-year BSc Natural Sciences students either take three modules from two subjects or modules from three subjects. Other combinations are possible, but this combination would normally allow you to progress with any or all three of these subjects, as well as starting some new subjects in your second year.</p>,<h3>Flexibility and choice</h3>,<p>The degree allows you to choose from a wide choice of subjects to include in your degree. It also allows you to delay the choice about the direction of your studies until the end of your first year (and in some cases to the end of your second year). Each year you can normally change your choice of modules within the first three weeks of the academic year.</p>,<h3>Depth</h3>,<p>The degree requires final-year students to undertake capstone modules which are student driven and involve independent thought, personal management of the work’s direction and are reflective of the degree's learning outcomes. Typically, these modules will have a very small taught component and staff act as mentors, rather than deliverers of information.</p>,<h3>Patterns of study</h3>,<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>,<h2>BSc (Honours) Natural Sciences </h2>,<p>With this route you could study the same three subjects each year. You could also build on your first-year studies in one or two subjects and then combine advanced modules in these subjects with a new subject(s) in your second year.</p>,<p>You could then study two or three subjects in your third year, all of which you must also have studied in earlier years. With this route you would graduate with a BSc (Hons) degree in Natural Sciences with your main subjects studied listed on the degree certificate.</p>,<p>At the end of Year 2, the BSc allows you the option of transferring onto either “with Year Abroad” or “with Placement” pathway.  Note that these options are competitive and so applicants cannot apply for these pathways through UCAS.</p>,<h2>BSc Joint Honours Degrees within Natural Sciences</h2>,<p>With a BSc Joint Honours degree in two subjects, you will study each of these two subjects in all of the three years of study. In the first year, there may be the opportunity to take modules in a third subject, if you wish. If you follow the requirements for a Joint Honours degree you graduate with a BSc Honours degree in A and B within the Natural Sciences degree (where A and B are replaced with the relevant subjects).  If a combination is not offered, it might still be possible for you to combine them with a third subject within a Natural Sciences degree that is not a Joint Honours degree. Please contact the Natural Sciences Admissions Selector for further details.  Note that the “with Year Abroad” and “with Placement” pathways are also offered as added extras with Joint Honours degrees. </p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>You must study at least two subjects, but no more than four, which give you a good progression into your second year subjects. You can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject.</p>,<h4>For instance, students who want to do the BSc Joint Honours degree in:</h4>,<ul>
<li>Biology and Earth Sciences must do four core modules, which leaves them free to choose any two optional modules from any subject on offer.</li>
<li>Economics and Mathematics must do five core modules from these subjects leaving them one free module from any subject.</li>
</ul>,<p>To find out the number of core modules for each subject you are advised to look at the <a href=""https://www.dur.ac.uk/natural.sciences/"">Natural Sciences webpages</a> as a guide.</p>,<p>BSc Natural Sciences students often take two modules from three subjects, although other combinations are possible, but this combination would normally allow progression with any or all three of these subjects. The design of the course is constrained by the entry requirements and limits of the University’s academic timetable which is published five months before the start of the academic year.</p>,<h2>Year 2</h2>,<p>You must study at least two subjects, but no more than three, which gives you reasonable progression into your third-year subjects. You can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject.</p>,<h4>For instance, students following the BSc Joint Honours degree in:</h4>,<ul>
<li>Mathematics and Physics must do five core modules leaving them free to choose another module from these subjects to achieve an equal balance.</li>
<li>Biology and Psychology must do six core modules.</li>
</ul>,<p>Students who are taking the BSc in Natural Sciences have considerable freedom which is only limited by progression and the academic timetable, so in this scenario they do not need to adhere to the strict Joint Honours rules. They must build on one or two subjects studied in their first year, but also have the option of starting a new subject by taking a first-year module in their second year.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The key characteristics of the Natural Sciences degree at Durham are choice, flexibility and depth. The Natural Sciences degree has a wide choice of subjects and in later years there is choice between modules within subjects. It is also a flexible degree and with most subjects you can delay choosing your subjects until you get to Durham and you can also change the shape of your degree at the end of the first year.</p>
<p><strong>The Natural Sciences degree has the following features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The degree is based at the Durham campus.</li>
<li>The University operates on a system of undergraduates studying 120 credits each year. There are 20, 40 and a few 60 credit modules, so students choose combinations of modules which add up to precisely 120 credits.</li>
<li>There are two types of degree that you can obtain, a 3-year BSc (degree code CFG0) or a 4-year MSci (degree code FGC0). Both the BSc and the MSci contain BSc Joint Honours and MSci Joint Honours degrees as well as the more broad BSc Natural Sciences and MSci Natural Sciences degrees.</li>
<li>You should note that not all combinations of all modules in all subjects are feasible. Choices are constrained by the limits of the University timetable, which changes every year.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>
<ul>
<li>a BSc Natural Sciences degree in which you study two or more subjects and start a new subject in your second year or carry on with the three subjects you have studied in your first year.</li>
<li>a Joint Honours BSc degree within Natural Sciences which involves studying the same two subjects in each of the three years (it is usually possible to study three or even four subjects in the first year).</li>
<li>take a Year Abroad in between the second and third years.</li>
<li>do a placement in between the second and third years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students on the Natural Sciences course design their own programme, so depending on their choices they learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical classes, fieldwork, informal but scheduled one-on-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing. All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO).</p>
<p>Tutorials, seminars, workshops, and practical classes are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow one-to-one interaction with a member of staff. Practicals also allow hands-on experience of the work of professionals in the disciplines studied on the course. The same is true of fieldwork and consists of engaging in, for example, geological, biological, geographical, or anthropological work in the field with members of academic staff. This emphasis on small-group and practical teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions.</p>
<p>The degrees in Natural Sciences are designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year. Small-group teaching and one-to-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the course) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a major project. In this way the degree systematically transforms the student from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the degree. Students can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars in various academic departments present their cutting-edge research.</p>

For this reason, you are encouraged to apply during your degree for a year-long placement with one of the Engineering Department's or the University's international partners, as an additional year of study. You may study in English at some of the partner universities, whereas at others foreign language skills are essential. You are fully supported by the Department both during the application process and during the year abroad. Language tuition is available in the first year in a range of languages as free elective modules and in other years through the University’s 'Languages For All' scheme.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The course is mainly delivered through a mixture of lectures, problem classes, practical and design activities. Typically lectures provide key information on a particular field of study and identify the main underpinning engineering concepts in that area. Problem classes then provide opportunities for smaller groups to work through practical examples, based on the knowledge that they have gained through their lectures and through independent study outside the degree's formal contact hours. Finally, practical classes allow you to gain direct experience of practical and interpretative skills through laboratory classes, design activities and a Professional Engineering Applications Course (PEAC).</p>
<p>The balance of these types of activities changes over the course of the degree, as you develop your knowledge and your ability as an independent learner. This is one of the key attributes that the course develops in you (thereby preparing you for work or further study once you have completed the course).</p>
<p>In the first two years, you will typically attend 12 hours a week of lectures (two hours per module) and have three hours of practical classes or design activities each week plus problem classes and small group supervision. In the first year there is a one-week full-time compulsory PEAC course and at the end of the second year there is a two-week full-time practical course. Outside timetabled contact hours, you are also expected to undertake your own independent study to prepare for your classes and broaden your subject knowledge.</p>
<p>The balance starts to shift in the third year, as you develop your abilities as an independent learner. In the third year, fewer modules comprise lectures, with an average of eight hours a week. This emphasis on using the independent study and research skills developed in earlier years is continued through the technical project that you will undertake. Under the supervision of a member of academic staff with whom you will have weekly one-to-one supervisory meetings, you will undertake a detailed study of a particular area resulting in a significant piece of independent research.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, you also have access to an academic adviser who will provide you with academic support and guidance. You will meet regularly with your academic supervisor throughout your degree and they act as your first point-of-contact for any academic queries. In addition to this, all members of teaching staff have weekly tutorial hours when they are available to meet on a ‘sign-up’ basis. The Department also has an exciting programme of research seminars and talks from industrial companies which undergraduate students are strongly encouraged to attend.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The programme is mainly delivered through a mixture of lectures, seminars, and practicals. Lectures provide key contents of a particular topic. Occasionally lectures might be delivered by guest speakers who are internationally recognised academic experts or practitioners in their field. Students can also attend the Durham Speaker Series, providing the opportunity to network with senior business leaders, staff and alumni.</p>
<p>Seminars provide the opportunity for smaller groups of students to solve problems and discuss and debate issues based on knowledge gained through lectures and independent study outside the programme’s formal contact hours. Practicals are medium sized group sessions, where students practice computer software, applying topics from lectures and seminars.</p>
<p>Students study eight taught modules, a mix of core and electives which enables them to undertake a more in-depth study of particular topics. This is then followed by a 12,000-word dissertation that allows students to carry out independent research and develop their skills in analysis and scholarly expression, using an appropriate theoretical framework. They are supported in writing their dissertation through the study of research methods and attending individual meetings with an allocated supervisor who monitors their progress and provides advice.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Support:</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the year, students may have the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities. They also have the opportunity to attend an International Study Week at an overseas location at the end of Term 2, which gives students the opportunity to learn about the business, economy and culture of another country, gain an ‘insider perspective’ on international businesses and network with key business staff. </p>
<p><strong>Learning Resource:</strong></p>
<p>Outside of timetabled contact hours, students are expected to undertake a significant amount of independent study in preparation for teaching sessions, assignments and other forms of assessment including exams, and general background reading to broaden their subject knowledge. All students have an Academic Adviser who is able to provide general advice on academic matters. Teaching staff are also available to provide additional support on a one-to-one basis via weekly consultation hours.</p>
<p>Students also have access to the facilities available at Mill Hill Lane including dedicated postgraduate working spaces, an onsite library and IT helpdesk.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>When you study English Literature at Durham you typically receive 8 contact hours per week in the first year (lectures and tutorials), 7 in the second year, and 5 in the third year (lectures, tutorials and seminars) per week. In addition, the course requires a very considerable amount of directed independent learning: a minimum of 30 hours per week, comprised of reading primary and secondary sources, writing formative and assessed essays, and preparation of tutorial and seminar assignments. From the outset the Department cultivates an ethos of research-led teaching and the acquisition of specialist study skills, as well as transferable skills. Throughout, particular emphasis is placed on small group teaching and individual academic development. The balance of contact hours across the course reflects your progression in research, analysis and writing.</p>
<p>In the first year, you take six modules, three in the Department of Philosophy and three in the Department of English Studies, which provide an induction into the disciplines of literary and philosophical study. Philosophical development is principally a matter of acquiring a range of reasoning skills, rather than familiarising yourself with knowledge. From the outset, the course places a strong emphasis on dialogical interaction. Lectures involve plenty of opportunities for questions and extended discussion, and tutorials consist mostly of structured, critical dialogue in the context of a friendly, supportive environment. The average contact time of 8 hours per week is supported by directed reading, tutorial preparation and essay research and writing, comprising at least 30 hours per week. Teaching methods are designed to support the directed learning model, for example, through the provision of reading lists, assignments, presentation briefs and online materials. Directed learning is also supported by the Durham University online learning environment. In addition to lectures and tutorials, four plenary sessions support and develop directed learning and study skills throughout the year and prepare you to make module choices for your second year.</p>
<p>In the second year, in keeping with the Department’s policy on academic progression, an increasing emphasis is placed on the development of critical and analytical skills. The curriculum continues to require you to engage with a range of periods and styles of literary and philosophical study, with modules introducing new problems in a more specific framework. You will take compulsory modules, The Theory and Practice of Literary Criticism and Moral Theory, along with two further lecture and/or seminar-based modules in each Department. These build upon lower level modules in a coherent, progressive fashion. Seminar modules have a strong research component and are taught in 2-hour, fortnightly seminar sessions, often involving individual or group presentations. Seminars involve significant preparation (c. 10 hours), typically reading assigned texts and secondary material, preparing assigned topics, and researching and preparing presentations. Individual consultation sessions allow for discussion of a plan of the first assessed essay with seminar convenors. Overall, the small group ethos is maintained in the second year. The average 7 hours of weekly contact time in Year 2 requires extensive directed learning and independent research of c. 34 hours per week.</p>
<p>The average contact time in the third year is 5 hours per week and you will be expected to take further responsibility for managing your own time. The curriculum, while continuing to offer support and guidance, will require you to use the skills in independent study and time management you have developed in the two preceding years. This will culminate with your dissertation, a large research project undertaken in either the Philosophy or English Department, giving you the opportunity to pursue extended creative and advanced research, and either literary analysis at a very high level, or intensive critical engagement with your own philosophical position and argument, depending on the discipline.</p>
<p>In addition to your dissertation, during the third year you will have the opportunity to take further specialist modules in both Philosophy and English. You will also be expected to spend at least 35 hours each week in independent study.</p>
<p>Throughout the undergraduate degree, you will be encouraged to participate in the Department’s extensive programme of research-related activities, including public lectures, special guest lectures, and lectures, readings and workshops by visiting UK and overseas academics and creative writers. Postdoctoral and postgraduate students regularly offer seminars and study days. In addition, you are invited to attend regular lectures and workshops on personal development and employment prospects, organised jointly by the Department and the Careers and Enterprise Centre. In addition to College mentors, who offer pastoral support, academic support is available from module tutors, seminar leaders, and module conveners, in addition to an Academic Advisor, allocated at the beginning of your degree.</p>

In addition, the course requires a very considerable amount of directed independent learning: a minimum of 30 hours per week, comprised of reading primary and secondary sources, writing formative and assessed essays, and preparation of tutorial and seminar assignments. From the outset the Department cultivates an ethos of research-led teaching and the acquisition of specialist study skills, as well as transferable skills. Throughout, particular emphasis is placed on small group teaching and individual academic development. The balance of contact hours across the course reflects individual progression in research, analysis and writing.</p>
<p>In the first year, you will take six lecture modules (three compulsory), which cover the main genres, historical periods, contexts and backgrounds to English literature. You may take up to two external modules. Weekly lectures are supplemented by small-group tutorials (an introductory meeting plus seven tutorials per module ). Specialist research, analytical and writing skills are developed in formative essays and individual feedback sessions, which play a key role in the delivery of the degree and in academic progression. The average contact time of 8 hours per week is supported by directed reading, tutorial preparation and essay research and writing, comprising at least 30 hours per week. Of this, recommended reading for lectures will occupy at least 3 hours per module per week: a total of 18 hours per week. Preparation for each tutorial typically involves at least 4 hours of directed reading and assignments; and research and writing of formative essays typically involves at least 8 hours per week.</p>
<p>Teaching methods are designed to support the directed learning model, for example, through the provision of reading lists, assignments, presentation briefs and online materials. Directed learning is also supported by the Durham University online learning environment. In addition to lectures and tutorials, four plenary sessions support and develop your directed learning and study skills throughout the year and prepare you to make module choices for your second year.</p>
<p>In the second year, in keeping with the Department’s policy on academic progression, an increasing emphasis is placed on the development of critical and analytical skills. You will take the compulsory lecture modules, ‘The Theory and Practice of Literary Criticism’ and ‘Shakespeare’. You may take up to three further lecture modules (organised for optimum historical coverage over Years 2 and 3) and a seminar module, which may be author- or theme-based, with a strong research component. Seminar modules are taught in 2-hour, fortnightly seminar sessions, which often include individual or group presentations. Seminars involve significant preparation (c. 10 hours), typically reading assigned texts and secondary material, preparing assigned topics, and researching and preparing presentations. Individual consultation sessions allow for discussion of a plan of the first assessed essay with seminar convenors. Overall, the small group ethos is maintained in second year lecture modules typically involving four tutorials and individual meetings with tutors for essay feedback, in which individual writing and analysis are developed. The average 7 hours of weekly contact time in Year 2 requires extensive directed learning and independent research of c. 34 hours per week: typically 14 hours recommended reading for lecture modules; 10 hours reading and preparation for special topic modules; 10 hours tutorial preparation, research and essay writing.</p>
<p>The average contact time in the third year is 5 hours per week. You will take four taught modules in the third year, in addition to a compulsory, double-weighted dissertation. Taught modules comprise lecture modules (up to three may be selected), which are delivered through weekly lectures and supported by tutorials (four per module); and research-focused Special Topics (up to two may be taken), delivered through fortnightly 2-hour seminars. The key focus of the third year is the further development of independent research, analysis and writing skills, which are emphasised in the Special Topics and find their fullest expression in your dissertation, a large research project which offers the possibility for extended creative and advanced research and literary analysis at a very high level on a topic of your choice and which forms a key element in the Department’s emphasis on undergraduate research and independent learning. While the emphasis is on independent research and writing, all students typically receive four 30-minute sessions of individual specialist supervision, and four 1-hour plenary sessions covering choice of title, research methods and skills, structure and presentation, researching, writing and referencing the dissertation (6.5 hours of supervision in all). Individual learning is also supported by the cumulative skills acquired over the three years in literary theory and analysis, close reading, essay writing, and research methods and resources. You are expected to spend at least 37 hours on independent directed learning per week: typically 8 hours on the dissertation, 14 hours on recommended reading for lectures, 5 hours on special topic reading and preparation, and 10 hours on tutorial preparation and researching and writing essays.</p>
<p>Throughout the degree, you are encouraged to participate in the Department’s extensive programme of research-related activities, including public lectures, special guest lectures, and lectures, readings and workshops by visiting UK and overseas academics and creative writers. Postdoctoral and postgraduate students regularly offer seminars and study days. In addition, you are invited to attend regular lectures and workshops on personal development and employment prospects, organised jointly by the Department and the Careers and Enterprise Centre.

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>This course involves both taught modules and a substantial dissertation component. Taught modules are delivered by a mixture of lectures and seminars. Although most lectures do encourage student participation, they are used primarily to introduce chosen topics, identify relevant concepts, and introduce the student to the main debates and ideas relevant to the chosen topic. They give students a framework of knowledge that students can then develop, and reflect on, through their own reading and study.</p>
<p>Seminars are smaller-sized, student-led classes. Students are expected to carry out reading prior to classes, and are usually set questions or problems to which to apply the knowledge they have developed. Through class discussion, or the presentation of student papers, students are given the opportunity to test and refine their knowledge and understanding, in a relaxed and supportive environment.</p>
<p>The number of contact hours in each module will reflect that module’s credit weighting. 15-credit modules will have, in total, 15 contact hours (of either lectures or seminars); 30-credit modules will have 30 contact hours. Students must accumulate, in total, between 90 and 120 credits of taught modules for the course (depending upon the length of their dissertation).</p>
<p>In addition to their taught modules, all students must produce a dissertation of between 10,000 and 20,000 words. This is intended to be the product of the student’s own independent research. Each student is allocated a dissertation supervisor, and will have a series of (usually four) one-to-one meetings with their supervisor over the course of the academic year.</p>
<p>Finally, all taught postgraduate students on this course, are encouraged to attend the various events, including guest lectures and seminars, organised through the School’s research centres, including the Institute for Commercial and Corporate Law, and Durham European Law Institute.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>One of the distinctive features of the Durham MA in Literary Studies is that it permits both a broad-based, eclectic study of literary topics from the earliest periods of literature to the present and the possibility of specialisation through designated pathways in such areas as Medieval and Renaissance Studies or Twentieth- and Twenty-First-Century Studies. All students take 3 optional modules, taught in small seminar groups of up to 10, with each module generating 18 hours of contact time (9 seminars x 2 hours) over the academic year. A strong emphasis is placed on independent research, and seminars usually involve a considerable amount of preparation, including short presentations and workshop activities. Assessment for these modules is usually by coursework essay.</p>
<p>All students also register for a triple-weighted dissertation, which generates an additional 20 hours of contact time over the first two terms in the form of fortnightly seminars, together with an additional 3.5 hours of dedicated individual supervision time in the third term. Strong emphasis is placed on independent research. In preparation for the MA dissertation, all students submit a 1,000 word research proposal at the beginning of the second term, and are given constructive feedback on it. A draft chapter (approximately 3,500) words will be read and commented upon by their supervisor.</p>
<p>Each MA student is assigned an Academic Advisor who can guide and support her or his progress during the programme of study.</p>

Students can also attend the Durham Speaker Series, providing the opportunity to network with senior business leaders, staff and alumni.</p>
<p>Seminars provide the opportunity for smaller groups of students to solve problems and discuss and debate issues based on knowledge gained through lectures and independent study outside the programme’s formal contact hours. Practicals are medium sized group sessions, where students practice computer software, applying topics from lectures and seminars.</p>
<p>Students study eight taught modules, a mix of core and electives which enables them to undertake a more in-depth study of particular topics. This is then followed by a 12,000-word dissertation that allows students to carry out independent research and develop their skills in analysis and scholarly expression, using an appropriate theoretical framework. They are supported in writing their dissertation through the study of research methods and attending individual meetings with an allocated supervisor who monitors their progress and provides advice.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Support:</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the year, students may have the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities. They also have the opportunity to attend an International Study Week at an overseas location at the end of Term 2, which gives students the opportunity to learn about the business, economy and culture of another country, gain an ‘insider perspective’ on international businesses and network with key business staff. </p>
<p><strong>Learning Resource:</strong></p>
<p>Outside of timetabled contact hours, students are expected to undertake a significant amount of independent study in preparation for teaching sessions, assignments and other forms of assessment including exams, and general background reading to broaden their subject knowledge. All students have an Academic Adviser who is able to provide general advice on academic matters.

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>This is a 12-month full-time degree course that runs from October to the end of August the following year.</p>
<p>For the Group Design Module, each group is supervised by one or more members of staff, and guided through the various stages of design. The principal learning outcome from this module is for you to understand the stages in the design of electronic and electrical systems. You should expect to have around 20 hours of contact time with their academic supervisors over the course of the design module.</p>
<p>A major individual research and development project is also undertaken on the course. This provides an open-ended challenge to each individual student, in collaboration with a staff supervisor. Regular meetings are held with the supervisor to discuss project progress and planning issues. A mid-term assessment is carried out to ensure project is on track. At the end of the project you are required to submit a final report on their work, in the style of a research paper. You are also required to prepare and to present a poster to allow an assessment to be made of your understanding and ability to present your work, plus an oral examination is held to allow detailed questions to be put to you regarding the technical aspects of your project. You should expect to have around 25 hours of contact time with your supervisors plus 500 hours of practical work, supported by the Department’s technicians and other research workers, over the course of the research project.</p>

Typically lectures provide key information on a particular field of study and identify the main underpinning engineering concepts in that area. Problem classes then provide opportunities for smaller groups to work through practical examples, based on the knowledge that you have gained through your lectures and through independent study outside the degrees formal contact hours. Finally, practical classes allow you to gain direct experience of practical and interpretative skills through laboratory classes, design activities and a Professional Engineering Applications Course (PEAC).</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;"">The balance of these types of activities changes as you develop your knowledge and your ability as an independent learner. This is one of the key attributes that you will develop (thereby preparing you for work or further study once you have completed the course). In the first two years, you will typically attend 12 hours a week of lectures (two hours per module) and have three hours of practical classes or design activities each week plus problem classes and small group supervision. In the first year there is a one-week full-time compulsory PEAC course and at the end of the second year there is a two-week full-time practical course. Outside timetabled contact hours, you are also expected to undertake your own independent study to prepare for your classes and broaden your subject knowledge.</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;"">The balance starts to shift in the third year, as you develop your abilities as an independent learner. Lectures still play an important role in supporting you in developing your knowledge and skills, with an average of 10 hours a week. The frequency of laboratory practical sessions and design activities remains similar, but the tasks become more open-ended.</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;"">This move towards greater emphasis on independent learning continues in the final year, where fewer modules comprise lectures, with an average of six hours a week. This emphasis on using the independent study and research skills developed in earlier years is continued through the research and development project that you will undertake. Under the supervision of a member of academic staff with who you will have weekly one-to-one supervisory meetings, you will undertake a detailed study of a particular area resulting in a significant piece of independent research.</span></p>
<p style=""background: white; margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;"">Throughout the course, you also have access to an academic adviser who will provide you with academic support and guidance. You will meet regularly with your academic supervisor throughout your degree and they act as your first point-of-contact for any academic queries. In addition to this, all members of teaching staff have weekly tutorial hours when they are available to meet on a ‘sign-up’ basis. The Department also has an exciting programme of research seminars and talks from industrial companies which undergraduate students are strongly encouraged to attend.</span></p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>In all of our postgraduate taught courses, we place an emphasis on empowering students to be autonomous, independent learners. The taught modules provide an introduction to module content which is then developed and extended through our use of online resources, key reading and independent study and research. We consider the development of independent learning and research skills to be one of the key elements of our postgraduate taught curriculum and one which helps our students cultivate initiative, originality and critical thinking.</p>
<p>On the MA Education course you will take compulsory core modules worth a total of 60 credits plus two optional modules worth 60 credits. Modules are offered either mid-week or at weekends, which provides flexible study routes and a wide choice of options. Modules are delivered using a combination of lectures, seminars workshops, and tutorials. The core modules are designed to provide you with a critical understanding of theories, research and issues relevant to your chosen course of study. Outside timetabled contact hours, you are also expected to devote significant amounts of time to reading, discussing and preparing for classes, assignments and project work.</p>
<p>In addition to the taught core and option modules all postgraduate taught students following a Master’s course will undertake a 60 credit dissertation. This crucial piece of work is a significant piece of independent research that constitutes a synthesis of theory, method, and practice in education and is supported by an individual supervisor, specialist dissertation workshops and the Dissertation Coordinator.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, all students meet regularly with an Academic Advisor, who provides academic support and guidance. In addition, Programme Leads have regular office hours where they meet students to discuss any issues. Module staff are also happy to meet with you to discuss module specific issues as needed.</p>
<p>In term time, the department also has an extensive programme of departmental and research group seminars which postgraduate students are encouraged to attend. Before the academic year starts, we provide information on preparation for the course.

All study abroad programmes are subject to approval by the Business School. Some partner relationships have restricted access and so are not available to all students. The Business School, in association with the University, will assist students in applying for a study abroad place, but it is the responsibility of the student to apply for such a place, and the right of the Business School/University to allocate students to available places as it deems best. In the event that a student is unable to obtain a study abroad place, transfer to the equivalent ‘non-study abroad’ programme is guaranteed provided the student is eligible to transfer on academic grounds. In line with Home Office rules, students from outside the EU will transfer onto the ‘with study abroad’ programme only once they have successfully secured a place abroad (normally at the end of their second year of study).  Therefore due to visa requirements, we recommend that international students interested in the study abroad year as part of their degree apply for this programme when making their application to us via UCAS.</p>,<p>The Study Abroad year fees are set annually by the University. For the definitive amount of the Study Abroad year fees payable please contact our <a href=""mailto:business.ug.studyabroad@durham.ac.uk"">Study Abroad Team</a>.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>Students on this course learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, workshops, informal but scheduled one-on-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing.</p>
<p>All of these are supported by a state-of-the-art virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO). Seminars and workshops are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow one-on-one interaction with professors, lecturers, and sometimes external speakers. Workshops also allow hands-on experience of the kind of work professional economists perform.</p>
<p>This emphasis on small-group teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions. In fact, the degree programme is designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year. Small-group teaching and one-on-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the course) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a dissertation - supported by one-on-one supervision -that makes up a third of final year credits.</p>
<p>In this way the degree systematically transforms you from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the programme.</p>
<p>Students can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars present their cutting edge research.</p>

This enables them to undertake more in-depth study of particular topics. The 12,000-word dissertation allows students to carry out independent research and develop their skills in analysis and scholarly expression, using an appropriate theoretical framework. They are supported in writing their dissertation through the study of research methods, and attending individual meetings with an allocated supervisor who monitors their progress and provides advice.</p>

It is a Social Sciences faculty degree that involves other departments within the University.</p>,<p>Students intending to have a career as a research psychologist need to acquire a high level of research skills at postgraduate level. Research methods training therefore forms a central part of the MA course, including both quantitative and qualitative research methods.

Finally, practical and workshop classes allow you to gain direct experience, particularly in Applied Statistics and in how to use statistical tools.</p>
<p>The balance of this type of activity varies as a function of the module. This is a one year course, with students having the summer term to work on dissertation related activities. You will typically attend approximately 12 hours a week comprising lectures, tutorials and seminars. Outside timetabled contact hours, you are also expected to undertake your own independent study to prepare for your classes and broaden your subject knowledge, as well as conduct your dissertation. Independent study is a key element to the course, with complex factors raised in lectures that do assume some prior knowledge of the topic area.</p>
<p>The course is divided into three parts. One third, comprising three modules, is of subject specific topics related to developmental psychology and developmental psychopathology, including issues relevant to clinical work throughout development. Across these modules the material is delivered via a combination of lectures, seminars, practical workshops and discussions. A further three modules focus on placing psychology in the larger framework of social science research and providing generic research skills. For example, skills such as qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The final third of the course is the dissertation module, which reflects the culmination of learning and practical endeavours from throughout the course via the production of an independent and original body of research material. This is performed under supervision with a member of staff, with meetings varying in duration and frequency throughout the year as a function of the needs of the research project and student.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The course is mainly delivered through a mixture of lectures, practical classes, tutorials and fieldwork. Typically lectures provide key information on a particular area, and identify the main areas for discussion and debate. Practical classes and fieldwork allows you to gain direct experience of practical and interpretative skills in Geology while tutorials address specific transferable skills and allows you to raise particular problems.</p>
<p>The balance of these types of activities changes over the course of the degree, as you develop your knowledge and your ability as an independent learner. This is one of the key attributes that you will develop (thereby preparing you for work or further study once you have completed the course). In the first year you typically attend six hours a week of lectures, and 12 hours of practical classes. You are also required to attend six tutorial sessions during the academic year. Outside timetabled contact hours, you are also expected to undertake your own independent study to prepare for your classes and broaden your subject knowledge. You are expected to attend a one-week field course in the Lake District during the Easter vacation.</p>
<p>The balance starts to shift in the second year, as you develop your abilities as an independent learner. Lectures still play an important role in supporting you in developing your knowledge and skills, with an average of six hours a week, and you will participate in six two-hour practical classes per week across the academic year that both introduce you to, and give you the chance to practice geological research methods. You are expected to attend field courses with the location being dependent upon exact module choices.</p>
<p>This move towards greater emphasis on independent learning continues in the third year. You are required to carry out a dissertation which may involve field or laboratory work during the summer vacation depending upon your exact choices and preferences. You will be assigned a tutor appropriate for your dissertation. Support for the dissertation will take the form of one-to-one tutorial sessions. This provides you with the opportunity to engage with academic issues at the forefront of geological research, in a learning environment that is very much focused on discussion and debate of these issues. This places a premium on preparing effectively for classes. This emphasis on using the independent study and research skills developed in earlier years is continued through the dissertation that you will undertake. Under the supervision of a member of academic staff who you will typically have three or four one-to-one supervisory meetings, you will take a detailed study of a particular area resulting in a significant piece of independent research. At Level 3 you are required to attend a one-week field trip to Cyprus, and there is the optional module which requires you to attend a field trip to Tenerife.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.3em;"">In the final year you will undertake another research-based dissertation that may involve field or laboratory work during the summer vacation depending upon your exact choices and preferences. The dissertation is conducted in collaboration with your academic tutor, the tutor being assigned dependent upon the nature of the research choice. Modules available in your final year mean that you will be expected to deliver seminars to your peers and to academic staff. You will also take part in a project developed in conjunction with an academic tutor and an industrial sponsor.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.3em;"">Throughout the course, you will have access to an academic tutor who will provide you with academic support and guidance. Typically you will meet with your tutor six times a year, in addition to which all members of teaching staff have an open door policy and are available to meet with on a ‘drop-in’ basis. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.3em;"">The Department also has an exciting programme of weekly one-hour research seminars which undergraduate students are strongly encouraged to attend, and there is a seminar programme run throughout the year by the student-led Arthur Holmes Society.</span></p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>Students on this degree learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials (politics), workshops (economics), informal but scheduled one-to-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing.</p>
<p>All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO). Seminars, tutorials, and workshops are much smaller groups than lectures, with tutorials often involving no more than eight students working with a professor or lecturer; seminars and workshops can be larger but are still small enough to allow one-to-one interaction with tutors.</p>
<p>Workshops also allow hands-on experience of the kind of work professional economists perform. This emphasis on small-group teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions.</p>
<p>In fact, the degree is designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as you move from your first to your final year. Small-group teaching and one-to-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the degree) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a dissertation – supported by one-to-one supervision – that makes up a third of final year credits.</p>
<p>In this way the degree systematically transforms you from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the degree and continue at key times throughout each year of the course.</p>

Lectures provide key information on a particular topic, such as ‘autism spectrum disorder’ or ‘developing interventions’. Seminars are held in order for smaller group teaching to take place, with focused discussion on specific topics. Finally, practical workshop classes allow students to gain direct experience, particularly in Applied Statistics and in how to use statistical tools.</p>
<p>The balance of this type of activity varies as a function of the module. This is a one year course, with students having a summer term to work on their dissertation related activities. Students typically attend approximately 12 hours a week comprising lectures, tutorials and seminars. Outside timetabled contact hours, students are also expected to undertake their own independent study to prepare for their classes and broaden their subject knowledge, as well as completing their dissertation. Independent study is a key element to the course, with complex factors raised in lectures that do assume some prior knowledge of the topic area.</p>
<p>The course is divided into three parts. One third, comprising three modules, is of subject specific topics related to developmental psychology and developmental psychopathology (with a specific focus on neurodevelopmental disorders). A further three modules focus on research skills, such as critical thinking abilities and statistical knowledge, that are necessary to understand developmental psychology and developmental psychopathology. The final third of the programme is the dissertation module, which reflects the culmination of learning and practical endeavours from throughout the course via the production of an independent and original body of research material. This is performed under supervision with a member of staff, with meetings varying in duration and frequency throughout the year as a function of the needs of the research project and the student.</p>

<li>Earth Sciences</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>

<li>Economics</li>
<li>Geography</li>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The key characteristics of the Natural Sciences degree at Durham are choice, flexibility and depth. The Natural Sciences degree has a wide choice of subjects and in later years there is choice between modules within subjects. It is also a flexible degree and with most subjects you can delay choosing your subjects until you get to Durham and you can also change the shape of your degree at the end of the first year.</p>
<p><strong>The Natural Sciences degree has the following features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The degree is based at the Durham campus.</li>
<li>The University operates on a system of undergraduates studying 120 credits each year. There are 20, 40 and a few 60 credit modules, so students choose combinations of modules which add up to precisely 120 credits.</li>
<li>There are two types of degree that you can obtain, a 3-year BSc (degree code CFG0) or a 4-year MSci (degree code FGC0). Both the BSc and the MSci contain BSc Joint Honours and MSci Joint Honours degrees as well as the more broad BSc Natural Sciences and MSci Natural Sciences degrees.</li>
<li>You should note that not all combinations of all modules in all subjects are feasible. Choices are constrained by the limits of the University timetable, which changes every year.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>
<ul>
<li>a BSc Natural Sciences degree in which you study two or more subjects and start a new subject in your second year or carry on with the three subjects you have studied in your first year.</li>
<li>a Joint Honours BSc degree within Natural Sciences which involves studying the same two subjects in each of the three years (it is usually possible to study three or even four subjects in the first year).</li>
<li>take a Year Abroad in between the second and third years.</li>
<li>do a placement in between the second and third years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students on the Natural Sciences course design their own programme, so depending on their choices they learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical classes, fieldwork, informal but scheduled one-on-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing. All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO).</p>
<p>Tutorials, seminars, workshops, and practical classes are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow one-to-one interaction with a member of staff. Practicals also allow hands-on experience of the work of professionals in the disciplines studied on the course. The same is true of fieldwork and consists of engaging in, for example, geological, biological, geographical, or anthropological work in the field with members of academic staff. This emphasis on small-group and practical teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions.</p>
<p>The degrees in Natural Sciences are designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year. Small-group teaching and one-to-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the course) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a major project. In this way the degree systematically transforms the student from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the degree. Students can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars in various academic departments present their cutting-edge research.</p>

<h4>MSci in Natural Sciences</h4>
<p>To take an MSci in Natural Sciences you must be taking at least one of the following subjects: Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Earth Sciences, Mathematics, and Physics. Biology has a very limited range of modules at fourth year level, so Biology can only be included in a Joint Honours degree with Chemistry or Physics. An MSci in Natural Sciences can be a slight variation from one of the MSci Joint Honours degrees below. Alternatively, it could be just one of the subjects above (say Chemistry) with modules from other subjects (say Anthropology and Philosophy) for the first three years. In this case, your fourth year would have to consist of all six modules from the subject listed above (Chemistry in this case).</p>
<h4>Joint Honours MSci within Natural Sciences</h4>
<p>The MSci is available as a Joint Honours degree in one of five pairs namely:</p>
<p>Biology and Chemistry; Biology and Physics; Chemistry and Maths; Chemistry and Physics; Maths and Physics.</p>
<p>Students on the Natural Sciences programme design their own programme, so depending on their choices they learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical classes, fieldwork, informal but scheduled one-to-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing. All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO).</p>
<p>Tutorials, seminars, workshops, and practical classes are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow one-to-one interaction with a member of staff.

The same is true of fieldwork and consists of engaging in, for example, geological, biological, geographical, or anthropological work in the field with members of academic staff. This emphasis on small-group and practical teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the number of formal sessions.</p>
<p>The degree programmes in Natural Sciences are designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year. Small-group teaching and one-to-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the programme) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a major project that makes up a minimum of a third of final year credits. In this way, the degree programme systematically transforms the student from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the programme.

<li>Chemistry</li>
<li>Computer Science</li>
<li>Earth Sciences</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Physics</li>
<li>Psychology.</li>
</ul>,<p>At least half of your studies in the second and third years in Natural Sciences must be from the subjects listed in Group 1. Not all subjects can be taken together.</p>,<h3>Group 2</h3>,<ul>
<li>Anthropology</li>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Economics</li>
<li>Geography</li>
<li>Philosophy.</li>
</ul>,<p><strong>No more than half</strong> of your studies in the second and third years can be from subjects in Group 2. Each of these subjects contributes to at least one Joint Honours degree with the subjects from Group 1.</p>,<h3>Group 3</h3>,<p>These subjects are Sport and Education (excluding History of Art) and are based in Durham City. None of the subjects in Group 3 contribute to a Joint Honours degree in Natural Sciences (and so no combination with these subjects is guaranteed to work in the timetable) and no more than half of your studies in the second and third years can be made up of subjects in Groups 2 and 3. If you are interested in taking subjects from Group 3, you are strongly recommended to contact the Natural Sciences Admissions Selector to judge on the feasibility of combining subjects from Groups 1 and 3.</p>,<p>Typically, first-year BSc Natural Sciences students either take three modules from two subjects or modules from three subjects. Other combinations are possible, but this combination would normally allow you to progress with any or all three of these subjects, as well as starting some new subjects in your second year.</p>,<h3>Flexibility and choice</h3>,<p>The degree allows you to choose from a wide choice of subjects to include in your degree. It also allows you to delay the choice about the direction of your studies until the end of your first year (and in some cases to the end of your second year). Each year you can normally change your choice of modules within the first three weeks of the academic year.</p>,<h3>Depth</h3>,<p>The degree requires final-year students to undertake capstone modules which are student driven and involve independent thought, personal management of the work’s direction and are reflective of the degree's learning outcomes. Typically, these modules will have a very small taught component and staff act as mentors, rather than deliverers of information.</p>,<h3>Patterns of study</h3>,<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>,<h2>BSc (Honours) Natural Sciences </h2>,<p>With this route you could study the same three subjects each year. You could also build on your first-year studies in one or two subjects and then combine advanced modules in these subjects with a new subject(s) in your second year.</p>,<p>You could then study two or three subjects in your third year, all of which you must also have studied in earlier years. With this route you would graduate with a BSc (Hons) degree in Natural Sciences with your main subjects studied listed on the degree certificate.</p>,<p>At the end of Year 2, the BSc allows you the option of transferring onto either “with Year Abroad” or “with Placement” pathway.  Note that these options are competitive and so applicants cannot apply for these pathways through UCAS.</p>,<h2>BSc Joint Honours Degrees within Natural Sciences</h2>,<p>With a BSc Joint Honours degree in two subjects, you will study each of these two subjects in all of the three years of study. In the first year, there may be the opportunity to take modules in a third subject, if you wish. If you follow the requirements for a Joint Honours degree you graduate with a BSc Honours degree in A and B within the Natural Sciences degree (where A and B are replaced with the relevant subjects).  If a combination is not offered, it might still be possible for you to combine them with a third subject within a Natural Sciences degree that is not a Joint Honours degree. Please contact the Natural Sciences Admissions Selector for further details.  Note that the “with Year Abroad” and “with Placement” pathways are also offered as added extras with Joint Honours degrees. </p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>You must study at least two subjects, but no more than four, which give you a good progression into your second year subjects. You can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject.</p>,<h4>For instance, students who want to do the BSc Joint Honours degree in:</h4>,<ul>
<li>Biology and Earth Sciences must do four core modules, which leaves them free to choose any two optional modules from any subject on offer.</li>
<li>Economics and Mathematics must do five core modules from these subjects leaving them one free module from any subject.</li>

You can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject.</p>,<h4>For instance, students following the BSc Joint Honours degree in:</h4>,<ul>
<li>Mathematics and Physics must do five core modules leaving them free to choose another module from these subjects to achieve an equal balance.</li>
<li>Biology and Psychology must do six core modules.</li>
</ul>,<p>Students who are taking the BSc in Natural Sciences have considerable freedom which is only limited by progression and the academic timetable, so in this scenario they do not need to adhere to the strict Joint Honours rules.

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The key characteristics of the Natural Sciences degree at Durham are choice, flexibility and depth. The Natural Sciences degree has a wide choice of subjects and in later years there is choice between modules within subjects. It is also a flexible degree and with most subjects you can delay choosing your subjects until you get to Durham and you can also change the shape of your degree at the end of the first year.</p>
<p><strong>The Natural Sciences degree has the following features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The degree is based at the Durham campus.</li>
<li>The University operates on a system of undergraduates studying 120 credits each year. There are 20, 40 and a few 60 credit modules, so students choose combinations of modules which add up to precisely 120 credits.</li>
<li>There are two types of degree that you can obtain, a 3-year BSc (degree code CFG0) or a 4-year MSci (degree code FGC0). Both the BSc and the MSci contain BSc Joint Honours and MSci Joint Honours degrees as well as the more broad BSc Natural Sciences and MSci Natural Sciences degrees.</li>
<li>You should note that not all combinations of all modules in all subjects are feasible. Choices are constrained by the limits of the University timetable, which changes every year.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>
<ul>
<li>a BSc Natural Sciences degree in which you study two or more subjects and start a new subject in your second year or carry on with the three subjects you have studied in your first year.</li>
<li>a Joint Honours BSc degree within Natural Sciences which involves studying the same two subjects in each of the three years (it is usually possible to study three or even four subjects in the first year).</li>
<li>take a Year Abroad in between the second and third years.</li>
<li>do a placement in between the second and third years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students on the Natural Sciences course design their own programme, so depending on their choices they learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical classes, fieldwork, informal but scheduled one-on-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing. All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO).</p>
<p>Tutorials, seminars, workshops, and practical classes are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow one-to-one interaction with a member of staff. Practicals also allow hands-on experience of the work of professionals in the disciplines studied on the course. The same is true of fieldwork and consists of engaging in, for example, geological, biological, geographical, or anthropological work in the field with members of academic staff. This emphasis on small-group and practical teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions.</p>
<p>The degrees in Natural Sciences are designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year. Small-group teaching and one-to-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the course) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a major project. In this way the degree systematically transforms the student from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the degree. Students can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars in various academic departments present their cutting-edge research.</p>

<h4>MSci in Natural Sciences</h4>
<p>To take an MSci in Natural Sciences you must be taking at least one of the following subjects: Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Earth Sciences, Mathematics, and Physics. Biology has a very limited range of modules at fourth year level, so Biology can only be included in a Joint Honours degree with Chemistry or Physics. An MSci in Natural Sciences can be a slight variation from one of the MSci Joint Honours degrees below. Alternatively, it could be just one of the subjects above (say Chemistry) with modules from other subjects (say Anthropology and Philosophy) for the first three years. In this case, your fourth year would have to consist of all six modules from the subject listed above (Chemistry in this case).</p>
<h4>Joint Honours MSci within Natural Sciences</h4>
<p>The MSci is available as a Joint Honours degree in one of five pairs namely:</p>
<p>Biology and Chemistry; Biology and Physics; Chemistry and Maths; Chemistry and Physics; Maths and Physics.</p>
<p>Students on the Natural Sciences programme design their own programme, so depending on their choices they learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical classes, fieldwork, informal but scheduled one-to-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing. All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO).</p>
<p>Tutorials, seminars, workshops, and practical classes are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow one-to-one interaction with a member of staff.

The same is true of fieldwork and consists of engaging in, for example, geological, biological, geographical, or anthropological work in the field with members of academic staff. This emphasis on small-group and practical teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the number of formal sessions.</p>
<p>The degree programmes in Natural Sciences are designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year. Small-group teaching and one-to-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the programme) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a major project that makes up a minimum of a third of final year credits. In this way, the degree programme systematically transforms the student from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the programme.

Other combinations are possible, but this combination would normally allow you to progress with any or all three of these subjects, as well as starting some new subjects in your second year.</p>,<h3>Flexibility and choice</h3>,<p>The degree allows you to choose from a wide choice of subjects to include in your degree. It also allows you to delay the choice about the direction of your studies until the end of your first year (and in some cases to the end of your second year). Each year you can normally change your choice of modules within the first three weeks of the academic year.</p>,<h3>Depth</h3>,<p>The degree requires final-year students to undertake capstone modules which are student driven and involve independent thought, personal management of the work’s direction and are reflective of the degree's learning outcomes. Typically, these modules will have a very small taught component and staff act as mentors, rather than deliverers of information.</p>,<h3>Patterns of study</h3>,<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>,<h2>BSc (Honours) Natural Sciences </h2>,<p>With this route you could study the same three subjects each year. You could also build on your first-year studies in one or two subjects and then combine advanced modules in these subjects with a new subject(s) in your second year.</p>,<p>You could then study two or three subjects in your third year, all of which you must also have studied in earlier years. With this route you would graduate with a BSc (Hons) degree in Natural Sciences with your main subjects studied listed on the degree certificate.</p>,<p>At the end of Year 2, the BSc allows you the option of transferring onto either “with Year Abroad” or “with Placement” pathway.  Note that these options are competitive and so applicants cannot apply for these pathways through UCAS.</p>,<h2>BSc Joint Honours Degrees within Natural Sciences</h2>,<p>With a BSc Joint Honours degree in two subjects, you will study each of these two subjects in all of the three years of study. In the first year, there may be the opportunity to take modules in a third subject, if you wish. If you follow the requirements for a Joint Honours degree you graduate with a BSc Honours degree in A and B within the Natural Sciences degree (where A and B are replaced with the relevant subjects).  If a combination is not offered, it might still be possible for you to combine them with a third subject within a Natural Sciences degree that is not a Joint Honours degree. Please contact the Natural Sciences Admissions Selector for further details.  Note that the “with Year Abroad” and “with Placement” pathways are also offered as added extras with Joint Honours degrees. </p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>You must study at least two subjects, but no more than four, which give you a good progression into your second year subjects. You can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject.</p>,<h4>For instance, students who want to do the BSc Joint Honours degree in:</h4>,<ul>
<li>Biology and Earth Sciences must do four core modules, which leaves them free to choose any two optional modules from any subject on offer.</li>
<li>Economics and Mathematics must do five core modules from these subjects leaving them one free module from any subject.</li>
</ul>,<p>To find out the number of core modules for each subject you are advised to look at the <a href=""https://www.dur.ac.uk/natural.sciences/"">Natural Sciences webpages</a> as a guide.</p>,<p>BSc Natural Sciences students often take two modules from three subjects, although other combinations are possible, but this combination would normally allow progression with any or all three of these subjects. The design of the course is constrained by the entry requirements and limits of the University’s academic timetable which is published five months before the start of the academic year.</p>,<h2>Year 2</h2>,<p>You must study at least two subjects, but no more than three, which gives you reasonable progression into your third-year subjects. You can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject.</p>,<h4>For instance, students following the BSc Joint Honours degree in:</h4>,<ul>
<li>Mathematics and Physics must do five core modules leaving them free to choose another module from these subjects to achieve an equal balance.</li>
<li>Biology and Psychology must do six core modules.</li>
</ul>,<p>Students who are taking the BSc in Natural Sciences have considerable freedom which is only limited by progression and the academic timetable, so in this scenario they do not need to adhere to the strict Joint Honours rules. They must build on one or two subjects studied in their first year, but also have the option of starting a new subject by taking a first-year module in their second year.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The key characteristics of the Natural Sciences degree at Durham are choice, flexibility and depth. The Natural Sciences degree has a wide choice of subjects and in later years there is choice between modules within subjects. It is also a flexible degree and with most subjects you can delay choosing your subjects until you get to Durham and you can also change the shape of your degree at the end of the first year.</p>
<p><strong>The Natural Sciences degree has the following features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The degree is based at the Durham campus.</li>
<li>The University operates on a system of undergraduates studying 120 credits each year. There are 20, 40 and a few 60 credit modules, so students choose combinations of modules which add up to precisely 120 credits.</li>
<li>There are two types of degree that you can obtain, a 3-year BSc (degree code CFG0) or a 4-year MSci (degree code FGC0). Both the BSc and the MSci contain BSc Joint Honours and MSci Joint Honours degrees as well as the more broad BSc Natural Sciences and MSci Natural Sciences degrees.</li>
<li>You should note that not all combinations of all modules in all subjects are feasible. Choices are constrained by the limits of the University timetable, which changes every year.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>
<ul>
<li>a BSc Natural Sciences degree in which you study two or more subjects and start a new subject in your second year or carry on with the three subjects you have studied in your first year.</li>
<li>a Joint Honours BSc degree within Natural Sciences which involves studying the same two subjects in each of the three years (it is usually possible to study three or even four subjects in the first year).</li>
<li>take a Year Abroad in between the second and third years.</li>
<li>do a placement in between the second and third years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students on the Natural Sciences course design their own programme, so depending on their choices they learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical classes, fieldwork, informal but scheduled one-on-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing. All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO).</p>
<p>Tutorials, seminars, workshops, and practical classes are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow one-to-one interaction with a member of staff. Practicals also allow hands-on experience of the work of professionals in the disciplines studied on the course. The same is true of fieldwork and consists of engaging in, for example, geological, biological, geographical, or anthropological work in the field with members of academic staff. This emphasis on small-group and practical teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions.</p>
<p>The degrees in Natural Sciences are designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year. Small-group teaching and one-to-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the course) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a major project. In this way the degree systematically transforms the student from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the degree. Students can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars in various academic departments present their cutting-edge research.</p>

You will also study issues of theoretical and social importance with lecturers who are international experts in their fields.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The MSc Criminology and Criminal Justice is a 1 year full-time course which may also be taken part-time over 2 years. </p>
<p>The course is taught by lectures, seminar discussion, workshops and presentations, and in some optional research methods modules there are computer-based practicals.  ‘Prisons, Crime and Criminal Justice’ is an innovative module taught within a prison using the Inside-Out dialogical pedagogy that emphasises transformative education.  It involves University students learning together with prisoners, completing the same readings and assessments, as well as group work and group projects.</p>
<p>For this module you will need to undertake security clearance and mandatory prison training before being allowed to enter the prison and eligibility to register on this module is dependent on these being successfully undertaken.</p>
<p>The MSc course is research-led at its core. For example, the compulsory module ’Criminology: Themes and Critical Issues' links explicitly with the research activities of the criminology staff. The module ‘Gender Violence and Abuse’ also links with the current research activities of the Department’s research group of the same name. You will subsequently undertake a 60 credit dissertation on a topic of your choice, supervised by staff who are actively researching in a relevant area. While this module is intended to afford an opportunity for a significant piece of independent and original research, it includes up to six hours of regular supervision which takes place typically from the end of term 2. You will also participate in two workshops usually alongside others researching in similar areas.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The BA Criminology course is delivered through a mixture of lectures, seminars, research-based workshops, individual supervision of research-based assignment and guided independent work through learning technologies. </p>
<p>Lectures provide key information on the key conceptual tools, methodologies, research and scholarship in the subject area. They also expose you to the skills of research synthesis and note taking.</p>
<p>Seminars are intended as guided, small group discussions of the subject area. They rely on independent study outside the degrees formal contact hours to be effective. They provide key learning scaffolding opportunities for your development of skills of conceptualisation and contextualisation, which are key for this course. You will also develop public speaking skills and research synthesis abilities.</p>
<p>Research-based workshops allow you to develop practical, hands-on experience of research in the subject area in the context of small group discussion and team working. Workshops are also useful for developing collaborative work skills as well as information gathering and analysis skills.</p>
<p>The balance of these learning contexts changes over the course of the degree, as you develop your knowledge and understanding of the subject and increase your confidence and abilities as independent, autonomous and critical learners. This is crucial not only for your integration into the social science community but also for success in diverse professional and working environments, as well as further study.</p>
<p>In the first year, you will develop foundational knowledge and understanding of key concepts and issues in the field of Criminology. At level one, you are expected to attend an average of six hours of lectures per week, as well as around six hours of small group-based teaching fortnightly, during the first two terms. Outside timetabled contact hours, you are also expected to undertake your own independent study to prepare for your classes and broaden your subject knowledge.</p>
<p>In the second year, the balance begins to shift, as you enhance your ability as an independent learner. You will engage with more advanced conceptual and theoretical issues as well as a range of skills and knowledge related to research design and practice.  While lectures still play an important role in supporting you to develop your understanding and analytical skills, small-group classes and independent work come to the fore, in the form of student-led seminars, research-based workshops and practical classes, and so on.  While on average you have the same volume of contact time compared with the first year, more of that time is spent with you taking the lead and drawing more explicitly on independent preparatory work.</p>
<p>The final year of study also has a number of unique study opportunities.  The dissertation module provides an opportunity to put into practice research skills you have developed in earlier years. While this project is completed on a largely independent basis, you receive guidance in the form of one-to-one supervision sessions with an academic member of staff in addition to general workshops addressing common themes and issues. Further, through the Inside Out: Issues in Criminal Justice module, you have the opportunity to learn about Criminological issues studying alongside local prison inmates.  The Community Placement module also provides an opportunity for you to apply your criminological skills and knowledge in a working environment while acquiring valuable work experience.</p>
<p>Across the course, assessment is primarily coursework based with essays, reports, portfolios and so on constituting around 80% of your final grade, depending on exactly what modules you take.</p>
<p>In addition to one-to-one supervision which you receive as part of your dissertation, your year tutor will provide general support and guidance on your studies across the course. Alongside this, all staff maintain regular office hours during which you are welcome to meet on a drop-in basis and can be seen by appointment at other times.</p>

Practicals provide opportunities to develop and implement skills, based on the knowledge gained through lectures and through independent study outside the course's formal contact hours. Self-development learning packages allow participants to continue their learning in a structured way outside the practical sessions. The industrial placement forms a major part of the contact time in the programme for Professional Practitioners, allowing you to gain direct experience of practical and applied skills in Conservation. Industrial partners have included the Museum of London, the National Museum of Wales and the York Archaeological Trust. </p>
<p>The balance of activities changes over the course as you develop your knowledge, skills and abilities as independent learners and practitioners. The course’s emphasis on taking learning from the classroom to real-life situations in Museums and conservation laboratories, prepares you well for work or further study once you have completed the course. All teaching is delivered by qualified conservators.</p>
<p>In the first two terms of the course, you will typically attend 4-5 hours a week of lectures, 6 hours of practical work including seminars, 3 hours of structured self-development learning and up to 9 hours of conservation skills working in the conservation laboratory. Outside timetabled contact hours, you are also expected to undertake independent study to prepare for classes and broaden your subject knowledge. The Department also has an exciting programme of weekly research seminars and talks by visiting scholars, which you are strongly encouraged to attend.</p>
<p>The balance shifts in the third term, as you develop your hand skills and decision-making through supervised practical conservation work.  This 11-week module leads to the creation of a portfolio of work that includes projects and reflections.</p>
<p>In the final year, you will spend nine months working in a conservation lab. You will gain experience working with a wide range of materials and further develop your practical skills, within a real-life working environment. A focus is placed upon problem-solving and organisational and managerial skills, under the supervision of a professional conservator. </p>

<p>The 180 credits one-year MA degree is divided into two core and two optional modules of 30 credits each. Furthermore, you will have to submit a dissertation of 60 credits of not more than 12,000 words. Most of the modules are delivered during the first two terms and you will spend the remaining time writing your dissertation.</p>
<p>PGT modules involve a range of different modes of delivery, but are largely based around lectures, seminars and other forms of active learning activities. The School places great importance on research-led teaching, which integrates new and cutting-edge research into the curriculum. Each module is build around 300 hours of learning, a large portion of which is independent reading and preparation. Class contact hours are all above 20 hours per module, with the exception of the dissertation, and are spread across the 12 teaching weeks in the academic calendar.  Typically modules would have elements of lectures, discussions, and presentations or other activities — the extent of each of these components would differ from one module to another.</p>
<p>All modules include a formative assessment to help you prepare for summative assignments by allowing you to identify what aspects of your work you are doing well on and which areas require improvement. You are encouraged to make appointments with the course lecturers to discuss module content, and after you have received it, any feedback on your work.</p>
<p>Typically summative assessments are around 3000 words, but these vary based on learning outcomes, assessment type, and module design. Some modules may be assessed by examination. The majority of coursework involves independent reading and written assignments, but you will have the opportunity to discuss course material as well either through presentations or class discussions.  You will be assigned a dissertation supervisor, who will also act as your academic advisor, and is someone you can consult throughout the year for general academic support, in addition to dissertation supervision.</p>

The course places a strong emphasis on language training, on theoretically informed approaches to Classical texts, and on practical engagement with your chosen specialism. The course lasts for one year full-time (two years part-time).</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The MA in Classics is principally conceived as a research training course, which aims to build on the skills in independent learning acquired in the course of the student’s first degree and enable them to undertake fully independent research at a higher level. Contact time with tutors for taught modules is typically a total of <strong>5 hours per week</strong> (rising to 7 for someone beginning Latin or ancient Greek at this level), with an emphasis on small group teaching, and a structure that maximises the value of this time, and best encourages and focuses the student’s own independent study and preparation. On average, around <strong>2 hours a week</strong> of other relevant academic contact (research seminars, dissertation supervision) is also available.</p>
<p>At the heart of the course is the Dissertation module, in which students write a 15,000 word dissertation of a research topic of their own devising. Core research training and support for students’ dissertation research is provided through the Dissertation seminars. These are weekly classes which in the first term introduce the range of <strong>research methods</strong> <strong>and resources</strong> available to someone working in the field of Classics, and over the year build the research skills needed for the dissertation. The classes comprise a mixture of lectures, student-led discussions and student presentations, and are tailored to the individual research interests of each cohort. In addition, students are matched with an individual Dissertation supervisor, who will be an expert in their field of interest, and from whom they will receive an additional five hours of individual dissertation supervision over the year.</p>
<p>In addition to the Dissertation, students select <strong>four or five further optional modules</strong> dealing with particular specialised subjects. At least one of these must involve work with a relevant language (ancient or modern). We offer tuition in Greek and Latin at all levels, including beginners classes for those with no previous experience in the subject, and advanced Greek and Latin Text Seminars for those with degree-level knowledge. Other ancient languages on offer at Durham include Akkadian, Hebrew and Aramaic; modern languages include German, French and Italian (there are usually specialised reading skills courses in these languages, designed to meet the needs of postgraduates who wish to use them for research).</p>
<p>All the optional modules offered at Durham are research-led, i.e. they will form part of the current research activity of the tutor taking the module. Numbers for each module are typically very small (often no more than five or six in a class). Typically, classes are two hours long and held fortnightly, and discussion is based on student presentations. (Modules for those beginning ancient Latin or Greek are typically more heavily subscribed, but their classes also meet more often: 3 hours per week.)</p>
<p>In exceptional cases, students with a particular research training need which matches Departmental expertise but is not covered by the taught provision in our or other Departments in any given year may also make a proposal to take an <strong>Independent Research Topic</strong> in place of one taught MA module. For an IRT, students produce an independent piece of research with an individual member of staff (usually a 5,000-word commentary or extended essay), receiving 5 hours of supervision. (Nb. There can be no overlap between the IRT and the Dissertation, and students must demonstrate on entry that they have the required expertise, and need, for project work in the relevant area).</p>
<p>All staff teaching on the MA are available for consultation by students, and run weekly office hours in addition to formal contact time. The MA Director acts as Academic Adviser to MA students, and is available as an additional point of contact, especially for matters concerning academic progress.</p>
<p>In addition to the formal part of the course, the Department has a very vibrant culture of research seminars and talks. In particular, MA students are strongly encouraged to attend the Department’s two research seminar series. Although not a formal (assessed) part of the MA, engagement with these seminars across a range of subjects is part of students’ development as researchers and ought to be viewed as essential to their course. In addition, MA students are welcome to attend and present at the ‘Junior Work-in-Progress’ seminar series organised by the PhD students in the Department. Finally, our student-run Classics Society regularly organises guest speakers – often very high-profile scholars from outside Durham.</p>

<p>All of are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO). Seminars, workshops, and practical classes are much smaller groups than lectures. In some subjects practicals also allow hands-on experience of the work of professionals in the disciplines studied on the course.</p>
<p>The emphasis on small-group and practical teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the number of formal sessions. Small-group teaching and one-on-one attention from your personal academic adviser (provided when you start) are part of the learning experience throughout, by the final year classroom time gives way to independent research, including a dissertation, supported by one-on-one supervision that makes up a third of your final year credits. This degree transforms you from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life.</p>
<p>These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin the week before you start and continue at key times throughout each year of the course.</p>
<p>You can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars in various academic departments present their cutting-edge research.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The BA Classical Civilisation will give you an average of <strong>8 hours</strong> of timetabled tuition every week. </p>
<p>The aim of the course is to help you become an independent learner and researcher in the field of Classical Civilisation. In order to do this, it progresses from a greater number of contact hours, designed to promote and support your own study, to a greater intensity of contact in more specialised areas as you gain in independence and experience. </p>
<p>The contact time is made up of weekly lectures, delivered by experts who are active in research in the relevant fields, supported by smaller-group seminars or tutorials per module, designed to give you the opportunity to explore the material covered in lectures in more depth, and to receive detailed feedback on formative assignments. </p>
<p><strong>First-year modules</strong> focus on ensuring that you have a bedrock of knowledge and skills across a number of sub-disciplines which you share with all other students in the Department. Two core modules, 'Introduction to the Greek World' and 'Monuments and Memory', include seminars with a special emphasis on research skills. </p>
<p>In the <strong>second and third years</strong> topics are increasingly offered from current research interests of lecturers; lecture and seminar/tutorial sizes become smaller and there is more scope for interaction with staff.</p>
<p>Your<strong> final-year dissertation</strong> gives you your richest opportunity to exercise your skills in independent learning and research. You receive support in choosing a topic at the end of your second year; and one-to-one supervisory support with an expert in the field through the writing of your dissertation in your final year. </p>
<p>Every module coordinator is available for consultation about particular issues, and advertises office hours when their presence can be guaranteed. You will be allocated an academic mentor who you will discuss your module choices with, in the context of your interests and aims (academic and personal). Mentors are available for consultation throughout the year.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to attend the Department’s research seminar series, which are scheduled at times when you would be available to attend. In addition, the student-run Classics Society regularly organises guest speakers. </p>

<p>Lectures provide the key information on a particular area and form the main basis by which you will learn the fundamental concepts and facts of the subject. In tutorials and workshops you will acquire and consolidate subject-specific knowledge, and also develop problem-solving skills embodying the concepts from lectures in a formative environment.</p>
<p>Revision classes in the first year prepare for the end of year examinations. Problem classes are used in the first year to develop mathematical and other quantitative skills in a problem-solving environment. Laboratory classes are used to teach, develop and refine the subject-specific experimental skills of synthesis, measurement and characterisation that characterise a competent chemistry graduate, whilst applying concepts from lectures in an experimental environment.</p>
<p>For the first three years of the course, you are expected to spend a minimum of one subsequent hour per hour of lecture contact on private study, reading and problem-solving using textbooks and other resources. Additional private study is directed at preparing for tutorials, workshops, writing reports of laboratory work and revision for examinations. In the four compulsory modules you will attend seven hours of lectures, two hours of tutorials or problem classes and six hours of laboratory work each week. Additionally, a third of the year’s credits are from elective modules which involve between two and six hours of lectures and laboratories each week. On this course at least half of the elective modules are in the study of an appropriate foreign language. Individual learning forms an important part of academic study.</p>
<p>In the second and third years, you will typically attend 12 hours of lectures or workshops per week and 10 hours of laboratory work. The laboratory work in the course moves from a defined set of practicals in the first year towards a more open-ended course, providing choice and some element of project work in Year 3.</p>
<p>The major element of the fourth year is an independent individual research project, carrying out novel chemistry research embedded within a research group in an overseas university, normally one that we have an exchange agreement with. Research is carried out under the supervision of a member of academic staff of that overseas university, and a member of Durham staff will maintain regular contact with you. You will typically work for 20 to 30 hours per week for at least 19 weeks and prepare a project report describing your findings which is assessed by Durham staff. The assessment also includes a poster and an oral presentation, training is provided in these skills. In addition, you will study for a sixth of your final year credits in a module of distance learning which is based on one of the lecture modules delivered in Durham and supported through our virtual learning environment. The independent learning skills you developed at earlier levels are enhanced by this mode of study.</p>
<p>You are allocated an academic adviser at the start of the course, who normally delivers some first-year tutorials, provides feedback on examination performance and remains with you throughout the course. Meetings between you and your adviser are timetabled three times a year, but you can always request further meetings. All members of staff are available to meet students on an “open office” basis.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The key characteristics of the Natural Sciences degree at Durham are choice, flexibility and depth. The Natural Sciences degree programme has a wide choice of subjects and there is choice between modules within subjects. It is also a flexible degree programme and with most subjects you can delay choosing your subjects until you get to Durham and you can also change the shape of your degree at the end of the first year.</p>
<p><strong>The Natural Sciences degree programme has the following features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The degree programme is based at the Durham campus.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The University operates on a system of undergraduates studying 120 credits each year drawn by combining modules offered by departments.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There are two types of degree that you can obtain, a 3-year BSc (degree code CFG0) or a 4-year MSci (degree code FGC0). The MSci is only available in certain subjects, namely Biology, Computer Science, Chemistry, Earth Sciences, Maths and Physics. Both the BSc and the MSci contain BSc Joint Honours and MSci Joint Honours degrees as well as the more broad BSc Natural Sciences and MSci Natural Sciences degrees. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You should note that not all combinations of all modules in all subjects are feasible. Choices are constrained by the limits of the University timetable, which changes every year.</li>
</ul>
<h4>MSci in Natural Sciences</h4>
<p>To take an MSci in Natural Sciences you must be taking at least one of the following subjects: Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Earth Sciences, Mathematics, and Physics. Biology has a very limited range of modules at fourth year level, so Biology can only be included in a Joint Honours degree with Chemistry or Physics. An MSci in Natural Sciences can be a slight variation from one of the MSci Joint Honours degrees below. Alternatively, it could be just one of the subjects above (say Chemistry) with modules from other subjects (say Anthropology and Philosophy) for the first three years. In this case, your fourth year would have to consist of all six modules from the subject listed above (Chemistry in this case).</p>
<h4>Joint Honours MSci within Natural Sciences</h4>
<p>The MSci is available as a Joint Honours degree in one of five pairs namely:</p>
<p>Biology and Chemistry; Biology and Physics; Chemistry and Maths; Chemistry and Physics; Maths and Physics.</p>
<p>Students on the Natural Sciences programme design their own programme, so depending on their choices they learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical classes, fieldwork, informal but scheduled one-to-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing. All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO).</p>
<p>Tutorials, seminars, workshops, and practical classes are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow one-to-one interaction with a member of staff. Practicals also allow hands-on experience of the work of professionals in the disciplines studied on the programme. The same is true of fieldwork and consists of engaging in, for example, geological, biological, geographical, or anthropological work in the field with members of academic staff. This emphasis on small-group and practical teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the number of formal sessions.</p>
<p>The degree programmes in Natural Sciences are designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year. Small-group teaching and one-to-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the programme) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a major project that makes up a minimum of a third of final year credits. In this way, the degree programme systematically transforms the student from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the programme. Students can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars in various academic departments present their cutting-edge research.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The key characteristics of the Natural Sciences degree at Durham are choice, flexibility and depth. The Natural Sciences degree programme has a wide choice of subjects and there is choice between modules within subjects. It is also a flexible degree programme and with most subjects you can delay choosing your subjects until you get to Durham and you can also change the shape of your degree at the end of the first year.</p>
<p><strong>The Natural Sciences degree programme has the following features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The degree programme is based at the Durham campus.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The University operates on a system of undergraduates studying 120 credits each year drawn by combining modules offered by departments.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There are two types of degree that you can obtain, a 3-year BSc (degree code CFG0) or a 4-year MSci (degree code FGC0). The MSci is only available in certain subjects, namely Biology, Computer Science, Chemistry, Earth Sciences, Maths and Physics. Both the BSc and the MSci contain BSc Joint Honours and MSci Joint Honours degrees as well as the more broad BSc Natural Sciences and MSci Natural Sciences degrees. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You should note that not all combinations of all modules in all subjects are feasible. Choices are constrained by the limits of the University timetable, which changes every year.</li>
</ul>
<h4>MSci in Natural Sciences</h4>
<p>To take an MSci in Natural Sciences you must be taking at least one of the following subjects: Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Earth Sciences, Mathematics, and Physics. Biology has a very limited range of modules at fourth year level, so Biology can only be included in a Joint Honours degree with Chemistry or Physics. An MSci in Natural Sciences can be a slight variation from one of the MSci Joint Honours degrees below. Alternatively, it could be just one of the subjects above (say Chemistry) with modules from other subjects (say Anthropology and Philosophy) for the first three years. In this case, your fourth year would have to consist of all six modules from the subject listed above (Chemistry in this case).</p>
<h4>Joint Honours MSci within Natural Sciences</h4>
<p>The MSci is available as a Joint Honours degree in one of five pairs namely:</p>
<p>Biology and Chemistry; Biology and Physics; Chemistry and Maths; Chemistry and Physics; Maths and Physics.</p>
<p>Students on the Natural Sciences programme design their own programme, so depending on their choices they learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical classes, fieldwork, informal but scheduled one-to-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing. All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO).</p>
<p>Tutorials, seminars, workshops, and practical classes are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow one-to-one interaction with a member of staff. Practicals also allow hands-on experience of the work of professionals in the disciplines studied on the programme. The same is true of fieldwork and consists of engaging in, for example, geological, biological, geographical, or anthropological work in the field with members of academic staff. This emphasis on small-group and practical teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the number of formal sessions.</p>
<p>The degree programmes in Natural Sciences are designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year. Small-group teaching and one-to-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the programme) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a major project that makes up a minimum of a third of final year credits. In this way, the degree programme systematically transforms the student from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the programme. Students can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars in various academic departments present their cutting-edge research.</p>

You will also gain a broad range of practical skills in synthesis, physical measurement and data analysis. In your third year you will have an opportunity to demonstrate the research skills you have developed. Throughout the degree you will develop your chemical understanding, problem-solving and practical skills, whilst learning how to learn. Graduates of this degreee are well-prepared for Masters level study, work in the chemicals sector, and roles requiring problem-solving and numeracy skills.</p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>You will study 120 credits per academic year. In the first year, there are 80 credits of chemistry modules that teach you the basics of inorganic, organic and physical chemistry, consolidating and building on pre-university courses.

</ul>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>Chemistry is a linear, quantitative subject containing a significant volume of factual material. It is an experimental science where practical work, and development of practical skills, is important. This three-year course is delivered through a mixture of “Core” and “add-on” modules using lectures, tutorials, problem classes and laboratory practical work.</p>
<p>Lectures provide the key information on a particular area and form the main basis by which you will learn the fundamental concepts and facts of the subject. In tutorials and workshops you will acquire and consolidate subject-specific knowledge, and also develop problem-solving skills embodying the concepts from lectures in a formative environment.</p>
<p>Revision classes are used in the first year in preparation for the end of year examinations. Problem classes are used in the first year to develop mathematical and other quantitative skills in a problem-solving environment. We use laboratory classes to teach, develop and refine subject-specific experimental skills of synthesis, measurement and characterisation that characterise a competent chemistry graduate, whilst applying concepts from lectures in an experimental environment.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, you are expected to spend a minimum of one subsequent hour per hour of lecture contact on private study, reading and problem-solving using textbooks and other resources. Additional private study is preparing for tutorials, workshops, writing reports of laboratory work and revision for examinations. In the four compulsory modules in the first year, you will attend seven hours of lectures, two hours of tutorials or problem classes and six hours of laboratory work each week. Additionally, a third of the year’s credits are from elective modules which involve between two and six hours of lectures and laboratories each week. Individual learning forms an important part of academic study.</p>
<p>In the second and third years, you will typically attend 12 hours of lectures or workshops per week and 10 hours of laboratory work. A component of the third year is a literature survey based dissertation, where you will undertake a detailed study of a particular area of current chemical research under the supervision of a member of academic staff who you will typically have three or four one-to-one supervisory meetings.</p>

These subjects are divided into three groups:</p>,<h3>Group 1</h3>,<ul>
<li>Biology</li>
<li>Chemistry</li>
<li>Computer Science</li>
<li>Earth Sciences</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Physics</li>
<li>Psychology.</li>
</ul>,<p>At least half of your studies in the second and third years in Natural Sciences must be from the subjects listed in Group 1. Not all subjects can be taken together.</p>,<h3>Group 2</h3>,<ul>
<li>Anthropology</li>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Economics</li>
<li>Geography</li>
<li>Philosophy.</li>
</ul>,<p><strong>No more than half</strong> of your studies in the second and third years can be from subjects in Group 2. Each of these subjects contributes to at least one Joint Honours degree with the subjects from Group 1.</p>,<h3>Group 3</h3>,<p>These subjects are Sport and Education (excluding History of Art) and are based in Durham City. None of the subjects in Group 3 contribute to a Joint Honours degree in Natural Sciences (and so no combination with these subjects is guaranteed to work in the timetable) and no more than half of your studies in the second and third years can be made up of subjects in Groups 2 and 3. If you are interested in taking subjects from Group 3, you are strongly recommended to contact the Natural Sciences Admissions Selector to judge on the feasibility of combining subjects from Groups 1 and 3.</p>,<p>Typically, first-year BSc Natural Sciences students either take three modules from two subjects or modules from three subjects. Other combinations are possible, but this combination would normally allow you to progress with any or all three of these subjects, as well as starting some new subjects in your second year.</p>,<h3>Flexibility and choice</h3>,<p>The degree allows you to choose from a wide choice of subjects to include in your degree. It also allows you to delay the choice about the direction of your studies until the end of your first year (and in some cases to the end of your second year). Each year you can normally change your choice of modules within the first three weeks of the academic year.</p>,<h3>Depth</h3>,<p>The degree requires final-year students to undertake capstone modules which are student driven and involve independent thought, personal management of the work’s direction and are reflective of the degree's learning outcomes. Typically, these modules will have a very small taught component and staff act as mentors, rather than deliverers of information.</p>,<h3>Patterns of study</h3>,<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>,<h2>BSc (Honours) Natural Sciences </h2>,<p>With this route you could study the same three subjects each year. You could also build on your first-year studies in one or two subjects and then combine advanced modules in these subjects with a new subject(s) in your second year.</p>,<p>You could then study two or three subjects in your third year, all of which you must also have studied in earlier years. With this route you would graduate with a BSc (Hons) degree in Natural Sciences with your main subjects studied listed on the degree certificate.</p>,<p>At the end of Year 2, the BSc allows you the option of transferring onto either “with Year Abroad” or “with Placement” pathway.  Note that these options are competitive and so applicants cannot apply for these pathways through UCAS.</p>,<h2>BSc Joint Honours Degrees within Natural Sciences</h2>,<p>With a BSc Joint Honours degree in two subjects, you will study each of these two subjects in all of the three years of study. In the first year, there may be the opportunity to take modules in a third subject, if you wish. If you follow the requirements for a Joint Honours degree you graduate with a BSc Honours degree in A and B within the Natural Sciences degree (where A and B are replaced with the relevant subjects).  If a combination is not offered, it might still be possible for you to combine them with a third subject within a Natural Sciences degree that is not a Joint Honours degree. Please contact the Natural Sciences Admissions Selector for further details.  Note that the “with Year Abroad” and “with Placement” pathways are also offered as added extras with Joint Honours degrees. </p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>You must study at least two subjects, but no more than four, which give you a good progression into your second year subjects. You can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject.</p>,<h4>For instance, students who want to do the BSc Joint Honours degree in:</h4>,<ul>
<li>Biology and Earth Sciences must do four core modules, which leaves them free to choose any two optional modules from any subject on offer.</li>
<li>Economics and Mathematics must do five core modules from these subjects leaving them one free module from any subject.</li>
</ul>,<p>To find out the number of core modules for each subject you are advised to look at the <a href=""https://www.dur.ac.uk/natural.sciences/"">Natural Sciences webpages</a> as a guide.</p>,<p>BSc Natural Sciences students often take two modules from three subjects, although other combinations are possible, but this combination would normally allow progression with any or all three of these subjects. The design of the course is constrained by the entry requirements and limits of the University’s academic timetable which is published five months before the start of the academic year.</p>,<h2>Year 2</h2>,<p>You must study at least two subjects, but no more than three, which gives you reasonable progression into your third-year subjects. You can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject.</p>,<h4>For instance, students following the BSc Joint Honours degree in:</h4>,<ul>
<li>Mathematics and Physics must do five core modules leaving them free to choose another module from these subjects to achieve an equal balance.</li>
<li>Biology and Psychology must do six core modules.</li>
</ul>,<p>Students who are taking the BSc in Natural Sciences have considerable freedom which is only limited by progression and the academic timetable, so in this scenario they do not need to adhere to the strict Joint Honours rules. They must build on one or two subjects studied in their first year, but also have the option of starting a new subject by taking a first-year module in their second year.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The key characteristics of the Natural Sciences degree at Durham are choice, flexibility and depth. The Natural Sciences degree has a wide choice of subjects and in later years there is choice between modules within subjects. It is also a flexible degree and with most subjects you can delay choosing your subjects until you get to Durham and you can also change the shape of your degree at the end of the first year.</p>
<p><strong>The Natural Sciences degree has the following features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The degree is based at the Durham campus.</li>
<li>The University operates on a system of undergraduates studying 120 credits each year. There are 20, 40 and a few 60 credit modules, so students choose combinations of modules which add up to precisely 120 credits.</li>
<li>There are two types of degree that you can obtain, a 3-year BSc (degree code CFG0) or a 4-year MSci (degree code FGC0). Both the BSc and the MSci contain BSc Joint Honours and MSci Joint Honours degrees as well as the more broad BSc Natural Sciences and MSci Natural Sciences degrees.</li>
<li>You should note that not all combinations of all modules in all subjects are feasible. Choices are constrained by the limits of the University timetable, which changes every year.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>
<ul>
<li>a BSc Natural Sciences degree in which you study two or more subjects and start a new subject in your second year or carry on with the three subjects you have studied in your first year.</li>
<li>a Joint Honours BSc degree within Natural Sciences which involves studying the same two subjects in each of the three years (it is usually possible to study three or even four subjects in the first year).</li>
<li>take a Year Abroad in between the second and third years.</li>
<li>do a placement in between the second and third years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students on the Natural Sciences course design their own programme, so depending on their choices they learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical classes, fieldwork, informal but scheduled one-on-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing. All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO).</p>
<p>Tutorials, seminars, workshops, and practical classes are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow one-to-one interaction with a member of staff. Practicals also allow hands-on experience of the work of professionals in the disciplines studied on the course. The same is true of fieldwork and consists of engaging in, for example, geological, biological, geographical, or anthropological work in the field with members of academic staff. This emphasis on small-group and practical teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions.</p>
<p>The degrees in Natural Sciences are designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year. Small-group teaching and one-to-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the course) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a major project. In this way the degree systematically transforms the student from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the degree. Students can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars in various academic departments present their cutting-edge research.</p>

</ul>,<p><strong>No more than half</strong> of your studies in the second and third years can be from subjects in Group 2. Each of these subjects contributes to at least one Joint Honours degree with the subjects from Group 1.</p>,<h3>Group 3</h3>,<p>These subjects are Sport and Education (excluding History of Art) and are based in Durham City. None of the subjects in Group 3 contribute to a Joint Honours degree in Natural Sciences (and so no combination with these subjects is guaranteed to work in the timetable) and no more than half of your studies in the second and third years can be made up of subjects in Groups 2 and 3. If you are interested in taking subjects from Group 3, you are strongly recommended to contact the Natural Sciences Admissions Selector to judge on the feasibility of combining subjects from Groups 1 and 3.</p>,<p>Typically, first-year BSc Natural Sciences students either take three modules from two subjects or modules from three subjects. Other combinations are possible, but this combination would normally allow you to progress with any or all three of these subjects, as well as starting some new subjects in your second year.</p>,<h3>Flexibility and choice</h3>,<p>The degree allows you to choose from a wide choice of subjects to include in your degree. It also allows you to delay the choice about the direction of your studies until the end of your first year (and in some cases to the end of your second year). Each year you can normally change your choice of modules within the first three weeks of the academic year.</p>,<h3>Depth</h3>,<p>The degree requires final-year students to undertake capstone modules which are student driven and involve independent thought, personal management of the work’s direction and are reflective of the degree's learning outcomes. Typically, these modules will have a very small taught component and staff act as mentors, rather than deliverers of information.</p>,<h3>Patterns of study</h3>,<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>,<h2>BSc (Honours) Natural Sciences </h2>,<p>With this route you could study the same three subjects each year. You could also build on your first-year studies in one or two subjects and then combine advanced modules in these subjects with a new subject(s) in your second year.</p>,<p>You could then study two or three subjects in your third year, all of which you must also have studied in earlier years. With this route you would graduate with a BSc (Hons) degree in Natural Sciences with your main subjects studied listed on the degree certificate.</p>,<p>At the end of Year 2, the BSc allows you the option of transferring onto either “with Year Abroad” or “with Placement” pathway.  Note that these options are competitive and so applicants cannot apply for these pathways through UCAS.</p>,<h2>BSc Joint Honours Degrees within Natural Sciences</h2>,<p>With a BSc Joint Honours degree in two subjects, you will study each of these two subjects in all of the three years of study. In the first year, there may be the opportunity to take modules in a third subject, if you wish. If you follow the requirements for a Joint Honours degree you graduate with a BSc Honours degree in A and B within the Natural Sciences degree (where A and B are replaced with the relevant subjects).  If a combination is not offered, it might still be possible for you to combine them with a third subject within a Natural Sciences degree that is not a Joint Honours degree. Please contact the Natural Sciences Admissions Selector for further details.  Note that the “with Year Abroad” and “with Placement” pathways are also offered as added extras with Joint Honours degrees. </p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>You must study at least two subjects, but no more than four, which give you a good progression into your second year subjects. You can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject.</p>,<h4>For instance, students who want to do the BSc Joint Honours degree in:</h4>,<ul>
<li>Biology and Earth Sciences must do four core modules, which leaves them free to choose any two optional modules from any subject on offer.</li>
<li>Economics and Mathematics must do five core modules from these subjects leaving them one free module from any subject.</li>
</ul>,<p>To find out the number of core modules for each subject you are advised to look at the <a href=""https://www.dur.ac.uk/natural.sciences/"">Natural Sciences webpages</a> as a guide.</p>,<p>BSc Natural Sciences students often take two modules from three subjects, although other combinations are possible, but this combination would normally allow progression with any or all three of these subjects. The design of the course is constrained by the entry requirements and limits of the University’s academic timetable which is published five months before the start of the academic year.</p>,<h2>Year 2</h2>,<p>You must study at least two subjects, but no more than three, which gives you reasonable progression into your third-year subjects. You can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject.</p>,<h4>For instance, students following the BSc Joint Honours degree in:</h4>,<ul>
<li>Mathematics and Physics must do five core modules leaving them free to choose another module from these subjects to achieve an equal balance.</li>
<li>Biology and Psychology must do six core modules.</li>
</ul>,<p>Students who are taking the BSc in Natural Sciences have considerable freedom which is only limited by progression and the academic timetable, so in this scenario they do not need to adhere to the strict Joint Honours rules. They must build on one or two subjects studied in their first year, but also have the option of starting a new subject by taking a first-year module in their second year.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The key characteristics of the Natural Sciences degree at Durham are choice, flexibility and depth. The Natural Sciences degree has a wide choice of subjects and in later years there is choice between modules within subjects. It is also a flexible degree and with most subjects you can delay choosing your subjects until you get to Durham and you can also change the shape of your degree at the end of the first year.</p>
<p><strong>The Natural Sciences degree has the following features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The degree is based at the Durham campus.</li>
<li>The University operates on a system of undergraduates studying 120 credits each year. There are 20, 40 and a few 60 credit modules, so students choose combinations of modules which add up to precisely 120 credits.</li>
<li>There are two types of degree that you can obtain, a 3-year BSc (degree code CFG0) or a 4-year MSci (degree code FGC0). Both the BSc and the MSci contain BSc Joint Honours and MSci Joint Honours degrees as well as the more broad BSc Natural Sciences and MSci Natural Sciences degrees.</li>
<li>You should note that not all combinations of all modules in all subjects are feasible. Choices are constrained by the limits of the University timetable, which changes every year.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>
<ul>
<li>a BSc Natural Sciences degree in which you study two or more subjects and start a new subject in your second year or carry on with the three subjects you have studied in your first year.</li>
<li>a Joint Honours BSc degree within Natural Sciences which involves studying the same two subjects in each of the three years (it is usually possible to study three or even four subjects in the first year).</li>
<li>take a Year Abroad in between the second and third years.</li>
<li>do a placement in between the second and third years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students on the Natural Sciences course design their own programme, so depending on their choices they learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical classes, fieldwork, informal but scheduled one-on-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing. All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO).</p>
<p>Tutorials, seminars, workshops, and practical classes are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow one-to-one interaction with a member of staff. Practicals also allow hands-on experience of the work of professionals in the disciplines studied on the course. The same is true of fieldwork and consists of engaging in, for example, geological, biological, geographical, or anthropological work in the field with members of academic staff. This emphasis on small-group and practical teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions.</p>
<p>The degrees in Natural Sciences are designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year. Small-group teaching and one-to-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the course) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a major project. In this way the degree systematically transforms the student from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the degree. Students can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars in various academic departments present their cutting-edge research.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The full-time MBA Programme is delivered through a mixture of sessions including lectures, case studies, individual and group presentations. Some sessions are delivered by guest speakers who are practitioners in the field.</p>
<p>Students study 7 core modules, and select 5 elective modules which enables them to undertake more in-depth study of particular topics. This is followed by a 15,000 word dissertation or Business Project to allow students to carry out independent research and develop their skills in analysis and scholarly expression, using an appropriate theoretical framework. They are supported in writing their dissertation through the study of research methods, and attending individual meetings with an allocated supervisor, who monitors their progress and provides advice. Where students choose to complete a Business Project rather than a Dissertation, this can be self-sourced or arranged by Durham Business School. The Business Project allows an opportunity to put new skills into practice in the real world, working on a live project with a regional, national or international company.</p>
<p>Students will typically attend 20 hours per week of core teaching in Term 1. In Terms 2 and 3 students would, on average (and dependent on elective choices), attend 12.5 hours per week of core and elective teaching. In addition, students have the following opportunities:</p>
<p>(1) A Boardroom Simulation Activity in Term 2, integrating academic learning from core modules into a live boardroom situation (compulsory)</p>
<p>(2) An International Study Week at an overseas location in Term 2, giving students the opportunity to learn about the business, economy and culture of another country, gain an ‘insider perspective’ on international businesses and network with key business staff.</p>
<p>(3) A Charity Consultancy Project in Term 3</p>
<p>Our MBA “Leading Edge Programme” incorporates skills development, career management and the Durham Speaker Series and runs throughout the academic year. Students have the opportunity of unrestricted individual meetings with a Career Consultant throughout the year and during induction they attend a three-day Personal and Team Development residential activity and additional workshops over three days. In Term 1, students can attend 19 hours of various workshops; 29 hours in Term 2 and 21 hours in Term 3 to enhance their interpersonal skills and career management. Students also have the opportunity to participate in the London City tour, the monthly Durham Speaker Series events and the Annual Durham Convention.</p>
<p>Outside of timetabled contact hours, students are expected to undertake their own independent study in preparation for teaching sessions, assignments and other forms of assessment including exams, and general background reading to broaden their subject knowledge. All members of teaching staff are also available to provide additional support on a one-to-one basis via weekly consultation hours.</p>

With this route you would graduate with a BSc (Hons) degree in Natural Sciences with your main subjects studied listed on the degree certificate.</p>,<p>At the end of Year 2, the BSc allows you the option of transferring onto either “with Year Abroad” or “with Placement” pathway.  Note that these options are competitive and so applicants cannot apply for these pathways through UCAS.</p>,<h2>BSc Joint Honours Degrees within Natural Sciences</h2>,<p>With a BSc Joint Honours degree in two subjects, you will study each of these two subjects in all of the three years of study. In the first year, there may be the opportunity to take modules in a third subject, if you wish. If you follow the requirements for a Joint Honours degree you graduate with a BSc Honours degree in A and B within the Natural Sciences degree (where A and B are replaced with the relevant subjects).  If a combination is not offered, it might still be possible for you to combine them with a third subject within a Natural Sciences degree that is not a Joint Honours degree. Please contact the Natural Sciences Admissions Selector for further details.  Note that the “with Year Abroad” and “with Placement” pathways are also offered as added extras with Joint Honours degrees. </p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>You must study at least two subjects, but no more than four, which give you a good progression into your second year subjects. You can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject.</p>,<h4>For instance, students who want to do the BSc Joint Honours degree in:</h4>,<ul>
<li>Biology and Earth Sciences must do four core modules, which leaves them free to choose any two optional modules from any subject on offer.</li>
<li>Economics and Mathematics must do five core modules from these subjects leaving them one free module from any subject.</li>
</ul>,<p>To find out the number of core modules for each subject you are advised to look at the <a href=""https://www.dur.ac.uk/natural.sciences/"">Natural Sciences webpages</a> as a guide.</p>,<p>BSc Natural Sciences students often take two modules from three subjects, although other combinations are possible, but this combination would normally allow progression with any or all three of these subjects. The design of the course is constrained by the entry requirements and limits of the University’s academic timetable which is published five months before the start of the academic year.</p>,<h2>Year 2</h2>,<p>You must study at least two subjects, but no more than three, which gives you reasonable progression into your third-year subjects. You can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject.</p>,<h4>For instance, students following the BSc Joint Honours degree in:</h4>,<ul>
<li>Mathematics and Physics must do five core modules leaving them free to choose another module from these subjects to achieve an equal balance.</li>
<li>Biology and Psychology must do six core modules.</li>
</ul>,<p>Students who are taking the BSc in Natural Sciences have considerable freedom which is only limited by progression and the academic timetable, so in this scenario they do not need to adhere to the strict Joint Honours rules. They must build on one or two subjects studied in their first year, but also have the option of starting a new subject by taking a first-year module in their second year.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The key characteristics of the Natural Sciences degree at Durham are choice, flexibility and depth. The Natural Sciences degree has a wide choice of subjects and in later years there is choice between modules within subjects. It is also a flexible degree and with most subjects you can delay choosing your subjects until you get to Durham and you can also change the shape of your degree at the end of the first year.</p>
<p><strong>The Natural Sciences degree has the following features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The degree is based at the Durham campus.</li>
<li>The University operates on a system of undergraduates studying 120 credits each year. There are 20, 40 and a few 60 credit modules, so students choose combinations of modules which add up to precisely 120 credits.</li>
<li>There are two types of degree that you can obtain, a 3-year BSc (degree code CFG0) or a 4-year MSci (degree code FGC0). Both the BSc and the MSci contain BSc Joint Honours and MSci Joint Honours degrees as well as the more broad BSc Natural Sciences and MSci Natural Sciences degrees.</li>
<li>You should note that not all combinations of all modules in all subjects are feasible. Choices are constrained by the limits of the University timetable, which changes every year.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>
<ul>
<li>a BSc Natural Sciences degree in which you study two or more subjects and start a new subject in your second year or carry on with the three subjects you have studied in your first year.</li>
<li>a Joint Honours BSc degree within Natural Sciences which involves studying the same two subjects in each of the three years (it is usually possible to study three or even four subjects in the first year).</li>
<li>take a Year Abroad in between the second and third years.</li>
<li>do a placement in between the second and third years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students on the Natural Sciences course design their own programme, so depending on their choices they learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical classes, fieldwork, informal but scheduled one-on-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing. All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO).</p>
<p>Tutorials, seminars, workshops, and practical classes are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow one-to-one interaction with a member of staff. Practicals also allow hands-on experience of the work of professionals in the disciplines studied on the course. The same is true of fieldwork and consists of engaging in, for example, geological, biological, geographical, or anthropological work in the field with members of academic staff. This emphasis on small-group and practical teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions.</p>
<p>The degrees in Natural Sciences are designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year. Small-group teaching and one-to-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the course) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a major project. In this way the degree systematically transforms the student from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the degree. Students can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars in various academic departments present their cutting-edge research.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The main method of delivery in the first three years of study are lectures, supplemented by practical classes and workshops. Lectures represent the largest proportion of the allocated contact hours and allow the effective delivery of large amounts of knowledge, which forms the factual basis of a science subject.</p>
<p>At Year 1 the emphasis is on core knowledge across the broad spectrum of the sub-disciplines of biological and biomedical sciences. In Years 2 and 3, there are more specialised modules enabling you to focus on a particular sub-discipline, with elements of choice in the course. As the degree progresses, there is an increasing emphasis on showing that biosciences is based on experimental evidence gained through research. At Year 3 lecturing is research-led and based on staff research interests. The proportion of the course delivered through lectures is less in Year 3, to allow a greater emphasis on your own research activities.</p>
<p>The lectures are supplemented by timetabled surgery sessions, which are used for problem-solving. Lecturing staff answer specific questions about the material they have taught through email, and by personal meetings; the Department has an ""open-office"" policy for responding to such queries. Typically, taught modules contain 35 one-hour lectures, two workshops, and one surgery session. You will take five compulsory taught modules in Year 1, six taught modules in Year 2, and four taught modules in Year 3, with two modules aligned to major pieces of research work. In the final year, there is a single taught Masters-level module on research skills, and five module equivalents based on research work.</p>
<p>Practical classes are a major component of contact hours and are an essential part of training in an experimental science like biosciences. Year 1 practical classes are used to train you in the basic techniques required for experimental work in the full range of biological sciences, you will specialise in specific techniques and areas of experimental work through module choice in Year 2. The practical classes are supplemented by workshops in which data handling techniques are taught. In both Years 1 and 2, the load of practical classes overall is one-two three-hour sessions per week. There are no, practical classes in taught modules in Year 3, since you will carry out two research modules at this level. The first is a field course or laboratory-based extended workshop, which offers you two working weeks' contact with staff. The second is a literature review, with a topic chosen from current areas of interest in biological sciences. This involves approximately six-eight hours non-timetabled contact with a supervisor. The fourth year of study will include an additional field course or workshop, and an extended research module extending across the majority of the year. This will involve you in a large amount of contact time with supervisory staff, typically involving weekly meetings during the project period, and working in close collaboration with research being carried out in the Department.</p>
<p>The philosophy is to have directed teaching and learning in Years 1 and 2, within which you are expected to develop self-guided and motivated learning, leading to a much greater emphasis on independent learning in Year 3, developing you to a Masters-level of research in Year 4.</p>
<p>Support is provided by a system of tutorial classes and academic advisers. Each taught module in Years 1 and 2 contains two tutorial classes, which are used to deliver specific content related to academic support, via small group interaction with academic staff. There is an emphasis on discussion and enhancement of the learning experience. Academic adviser sessions are used to deal with specific issues relevant to you, such as feedback on exam performance. Combined with project supervision, the tutorial/academic adviser system offers you fortnightly sessions with a tutor or academic adviser throughout your time here. A course leader provides overall academic support. </p>

Such engagement with texts and issues is not only an excellent preparation for doctoral research, it also develops those skills of critical analysis, synthesis and presentation sought and required by employers.</p>
<p class=""tablegrid1"">Many MA classes will contain a ‘lecture’ element, conveying information and exemplifying an approach to the subject-matter that will enable you to develop a clear understanding of the subject and improve your own ability to analyse and evaluate information and arguments. Seminars enhance knowledge and understanding through preparation and interaction with other students and staff, promoting awareness of and respect for different viewpoints and approaches, and developing skills of articulacy, advocacy and interrogation. Through small group discussions and tutorials, feedback is provided on completed work, with the opportunity to discuss specific issues in detail, enhancing knowledge and writing skills.</p>
<p>The Dissertation module includes training in generic research skills, from the use of the Library to issues in referencing and bibliography. The subject specific core module introduces you to questions of interpretation and argument in the disciplines encompassed by theology and religion, and helps to develop your own interests and questions that will issue in the MA dissertation. The latter is a piece of independent research, but it is fostered and guided through individual tutorials with a supervisor, with whom you will meet throughout the academic year.</p>

The breadth of complementary research strengths across the two Departments means that you are guaranteed to be taught by staff who are actively engaged in the interaction of psychological and anthropological approaches, and are leading figures in their field of research. </p>,<p>The joint honours degree is designed to enable you to understand what it means to be human in our rapidly changing world, including why we, and other animals, behave as we do and our interactions with each other and other animals.</p>,<p>In Psychology you will study people (and animals) in terms of their internal mental processes, the biological mechanisms that underlie their behaviour, and the social and developmental context in which they act.</p>,<p>In anthropology, you will use perspectives from human biology, cultural evolution, animal behaviour, and human evolution to illuminate inquiry into the mind and behaviour of past and present human and primate populations. You will learn how anthropology and psychology provide complementary and contrasting perspectives on what it is to be human, as well as a variety of quantitative and qualitative ways of addressing major questions. The interface of anthropology and psychology explicitly integrates intercultural, international and global issues.  For example, in anthropology’s traditional focus on cultural diversity and the burgeoning recognition of psychology’s need to address cross-cultural issues and move away from studies biased by Western Educated Industrialised and Rich (WEIRD) samples.</p>,<p>The degree provides the opportunity to develop extensive subject-specific, interdisciplinary, and transferable skills.  The course follows the British Psychological Society<em> </em>(BPS) guidelines with an extensive range of options in the final year, drawing both from work in fundamental scientific research and in applied areas of psychology and anthropology. You may choose to take modules that deepen your understanding of a smaller number of anthropologically and psychologically relevant topics or choose to take a more broad and varied selection. Several coherent pathways – for example in animal behaviour, infant and child development, and health – are possible, using complementary modules from the two departments.</p>,<p>Excellent research facilities are available, including a virtual reality suite, developmental testing facilities, and EEG labs (in psychology), as well as extensive collections of fossil hominin casts and material culture artefacts from around the globe, a sleep lab, hormone lab, and field station for primatology in South Africa (in Anthropology).

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>As a student on the BSc (Hons) Psychology &amp; Anthropology degree, your learning will be supported by formal teaching sessions, such as lectures and smaller-group teaching in seminars, workshops and practical classes. In general, lectures highlight the main areas of concern within a module topic, covering historical and current empirical findings and methodological issues together with their concomitant theoretical interpretations. Small group seminars guide your learning of lecture-based material and that gleaned through independent study by promoting discussions and critical appraisal, developing your ability to organise and present information both orally and in a variety of written formats. Workshops and practical classes enable you to gain first-hand experience of key research skills in Psychology and Anthropology, and to learn and apply associated statistical and IT packages.</p>
<p>Our curriculum places a strong emphasis on inquiry-based learning, with a particular focus on learning how to carrying out your own research. As you move through your degree, you will shift from being a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. To help develop this independence, you will spend part of your time engaged in self-directed study, which will include reading, project work and preparation for classes. You will also make use of the diverse research facilities on offer across both Departments. In your third year, you will undertake a dissertation on a topic of your choice that integrates psychology and anthropology, giving you the opportunity to engage in a major piece of independent work under the joint supervision of an appropriate psychology and anthropology staff member. The specialist topic modules are provided by lecturers eminent in their field, meaning you will have the unique opportunity to engage with and discuss the most recent theoretical, empirical and applied/societal issues.</p>
<p>Assessment on the BSc (Hons) Psychology &amp; Anthropology degree varies by module, but may include written examinations, coursework in the form of essays, practical reports or research projects, and presentations, posters or articles aimed at the general public.</p>
<p>You will be given a Year Group Tutor when you start your degree, and will normally keep the same tutor for the duration of your studies. Year Group Tutors are there to support your academic work by providing advice about such things as study skills, module choices, dissertation topics, and applications for further study or employment. There is also a termly First Generation Scholars coffee morning to provide additional support on the transition to University. As well as discussing your academic work with your nominated tutor, you are encouraged to make use of the Feedback and Consultation hours provided by academic staff during term-time. These Feedback and Consultation hours give you the opportunity to discuss your work with module tutors, for example, to seek clarification on complex ideas, get suggestions for additional readings, and receive further feedback on assessments.</p>
<p>As a student in the Anthropology and Psychology Departments, you will be welcomed into the wider Departmental communities and can attend an extensive programme of research-focused Departmental and research group seminars where academic staff, postgraduate students and visiting scholars present their cutting-edge research, which may provide inspiration for your dissertation topic and even future study or employment. In addition, there are student-led Psychology and Anthropology Societies that hold talks, meetings and social events.</p>

The dedication to our teaching and research consistently puts us high up in all the league tables. While studying here you will benefit from the buzz and creative environment of a large research department and join a dynamic and focused intellectual community. Our research ranges from fundamental elementary particle physics and cosmology to more applied topics in which we collaborate closely with industry.</p>,<p>We offer degrees in Physics, Physics and Astronomy, and Theoretical Physics, all of which are accredited by the Institute of Physics. Our course structures have been designed to provide flexibility in your final choice of degree course. The three-year BSc degree is aimed at those mainly interested in a degree in Physics as a preparation for a career not necessarily in the Physics area.</p>,<p>Our four-year MPhys degrees will suit those looking for professional training leading to research in physics or a physics-related career. The first year of the BSc and MPhys degree courses in Physics, Physics and Astronomy, and Theoretical Physics is identical, and it is possible to select modules in your second year such that you need not make a firm choice of course until the end of the second year.</p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>Foundations of Physics 1 is the main lecture module in the first year and is complemented with a practical laboratory module, including an introduction to programming. Two mathematics modules are taken in the Department of Mathematical Sciences. There is a further module of choice, with Introduction to Astronomy proving to be very popular.</p>,<h2>Year 2</h2>,<h3>Core modules:</h3>,<ul>
<li>Foundations of Physics 2A/2B</li>
<li>Mathematical Methods in Physics</li>
<li>Laboratory Skills and Electronics</li>
</ul>,<p>Additional topics also include Theoretical Physics 2 (the transition from classical to quantum mechanics), and Stars and Galaxies (an exploration of astrophysics), and Physics in Society.</p>,<p>At the end of the year, you need to decide your degree title, choosing between:</p>,<ul>

<li>Theoretical Physics</li>
<li>Maths Workshop</li>
<li>Physics into schools</li>
<li>Team Project</li>
<li>Laboratory Project</li>
<li>A module taken in another department (subject to approval).</li>
</ul>,<p>Your options will have an emphasis on astrophysics. </p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The course is mainly delivered through a mixture of lectures, laboratories, tutorials and workshops. The lectures will provide the means to give a concise, focused presentation of the relevant area of Physics. The lecture material will be explicitly linked to the contents of recommended textbooks for the module, making clear where you can begin your private study. When appropriate, the lectures will also be supported by the distribution of written material, or by information and relevant links on the University Virtual Learning Environment. </p>
<p>You will be able to obtain further help in your studies by approaching your lecturers, either after lectures or at other mutually convenient times (the Department has a policy of encouraging such enquiries). You will learn how to plan experiments and to interpret data quantitatively and systematically in the laboratory classes. Regular problem exercises will give you the chance to develop your theoretical understanding and problem-solving abilities. These problem exercises will form the basis for discussions in tutorial groups of typically six students in the first year. The tutorials will also provide an informal environment for you to raise issues of interest or difficulty.</p>
<p>The balance of these types of activities changes over the course of the degree, as you develop your knowledge, and your skills as an independent learner.</p>
<p>In the first year, you will typically attend 12 hours a week of lectures, one three-hour laboratory session per week, one one-hour Physics tutorial each week and two one-hour Mathematics tutorials. Outside timetabled contact hours, you are also expected to undertake your own independent study to prepare for your classes and broaden your subject knowledge.</p>
<p>A similar balance holds in the second year, although with a change from tutorials to module-specific workshops. In the workshops, typically three supervisors circulate among typically 50 students to provide support. By the end of the second year, you will have covered the vast majority of the material specified in the Institute of Physics ‘Core of Physics’, required for any accredited Physics degree, allowing them considerable flexibility in your choices for the remainder of your degree.</p>
<p>By the third year, you will have greatly extended your abilities as an independent learner. Although the contact time breakdown remains similar, there is considerable freedom in the way in which laboratory projects are carried out. There is also a possibility of performing a Team Project – open-ended research projects supplied by industrial partners, where you will be reporting back to the partner directly on your results.</p>
<p>This move towards greater emphasis on independent learning continues in the final year. Half of your time will be spent on a Research project in one of the (world-leading) research groups in the department. You will meet with a research supervisor for typically an hour per week during term-time, and depending on the project (laboratory-based or theoretical) may be working in the Department for an additional 12-15 hours per week. These projects are genuine open-ended research which has commonly resulted in material publishable in refereed Physics journals. In addition, you will typically spend six hours per week in lectures on advanced topics which can be chosen from the various research areas in the Department.</p>
<p>Throughout the degree, you will also have access to an academic adviser who will provide you with academic support and guidance. Typically you will meet with your adviser three times a year, in addition to which all members of teaching staff are available to meet with students, either on a ‘drop-in’ basis or during regular ‘office hours’. There are also regular seminars run throughout the year by the student-led Physics society and Astronomy society.</p>

Behavioural Science is a relatively new discipline that focuses on the application of psychological principles to challenges faced by organisations in the public, private, and third sector.</p>,<p>While Psychology puts an emphasis on internal mental processes that underlie behaviour, Behavioural Science emphasises behavioural outcomes, and the design and evaluation of interventions to encourage behaviour change.</p>,<p>As a student enrolled on the BSc (Hons) in Behavioural Science you will be taught state-of-the-art research methods, along with classic and cutting-edge theory and research in psychology, following the BPS guidelines. You will also learn how to apply this knowledge to provide novel and transformative insights for business, management, and public policy. Over the course of the degree, you will be taught by academics who publish at the forefront of their fields and who are also actively engaged in providing behavioural science consultancy, helping organisations to apply behavioural science principles and influencing public policy. As such, the degree combines cutting edge research with practical illustrations from the instructors’ own experience, supplemented by talks and seminars led by invited speakers from different sectors.</p>,<p>The degree incorporates a range of modules that will allow you to graduate with a deep and comprehensive understanding of the field of psychology, but you will also develop additional insights into the application of psychological science in the behavioural arena. The degree provides opportunities for the development of transferable skills, supplementing the opportunities afforded by Durham University colleges and the wider student experience.

<li>Statistics for Psychology (20 credits).</li>
</ul>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The degree is delivered predominantly by leading research academics using a variety of methods including lectures, small group tutorials, workshops, and practical classes, as well as additional individual feedback and support opportunities from staff and student peers. Psychology and Behavioural Science modules up to the value of 120 credits are taken in each of the three years of study, with each module having clearly defined aims and learning outcomes encompassing subject-specific knowledge, subject-specific skills, and generic transferable key skills.</p>

Workshops and practical sessions enable you to gain first-hand experience of key research skills in Psychology and Behavioural Science, and to learn and apply associated statistical and IT packages.</p>
<p>The number of weekly timetabled contact hours does not vary radically across the three years of the degree. However, there is a qualitative difference in the nature of the activities provided and in staff expectations: you are supported in becoming progressively more independent as thinkers and learners in preparation for further work or study on completion of your degree.</p>
<p>In the first and second years, you will typically attend six hours of research-driven psychology lectures every week; additionally, timetabled tutorials, practical classes, workshops, feedback and support sessions are held regularly throughout the year. These constitute an additional two to three hours contact time per week. Outside timetabled hours, you are expected to undertake independent study to prepare for classes, complete assignments, and broaden your subject knowledge. The emphasis in Year 1 is to provide you with fundamental knowledge and skills as a foundation for those who have had no previous experience of psychology and providing the bases underpinning second and third-year modules. In Year 2, your knowledge and skills are further developed and fostered; moreover, all the subject areas essential for accreditation by the British Psychological Society (BPS) and providing eligibility for Graduate Basis for Chartered Membership (GBC) are covered.</p>
<p>In the third year, you will select from a variety of specialist topic modules. As these are primarily provided by lecturers eminent in their field, you will have the unique opportunity to engage with and discuss the most recent theoretical and empirical issues. Year 3 modules are delivered through weekly two-hour lectures, seminars and workshops typically totalling eight hours per week. Additionally, building on research skills developed in their first and second years, and under the supervision of a member of staff, each third-year student completes an independent empirical study. Depending on the nature of the investigation, you might expect to meet with your supervisor on average once a fortnight throughout the year.</p>
<p>Throughout your three undergraduate years, you will have access to all your lecturers informally on a ‘drop-in basis’, by email appointment, or through advertised weekly office hours. All staff are willing to engage in discussions, provide support, feedback and guidance where relevant. There are also Module Leaders who are members of staff designated to deal with issues relating to modules as a whole and Year Tutors who are available to help when necessary with any problems that may generally affect your studies in Psychology.</p>
<p>The Department has a thriving research community: Seminars are held at least once a week during term-time to which undergraduate students are warmly invited. Additionally, research groupings within the Department and the student-run Psychology Society hold talks and meetings.</p>
<p>Further non-timetabled opportunities for support and debate are provided by the Research Assistant Scheme, and by online discussion boards facilitated by the Psychology Department.</p>

<li>Philosophy.</li>
</ul>,<p><strong>No more than half</strong> of your studies in the second and third years can be from subjects in Group 2. Each of these subjects contributes to at least one Joint Honours degree with the subjects from Group 1.</p>,<h3>Group 3</h3>,<p>These subjects are Sport and Education (excluding History of Art) and are based in Durham City. None of the subjects in Group 3 contribute to a Joint Honours degree in Natural Sciences (and so no combination with these subjects is guaranteed to work in the timetable) and no more than half of your studies in the second and third years can be made up of subjects in Groups 2 and 3. If you are interested in taking subjects from Group 3, you are strongly recommended to contact the Natural Sciences Admissions Selector to judge on the feasibility of combining subjects from Groups 1 and 3.</p>,<p>Typically, first-year BSc Natural Sciences students either take three modules from two subjects or modules from three subjects. Other combinations are possible, but this combination would normally allow you to progress with any or all three of these subjects, as well as starting some new subjects in your second year.</p>,<h3>Flexibility and choice</h3>,<p>The degree allows you to choose from a wide choice of subjects to include in your degree. It also allows you to delay the choice about the direction of your studies until the end of your first year (and in some cases to the end of your second year). Each year you can normally change your choice of modules within the first three weeks of the academic year.</p>,<h3>Depth</h3>,<p>The degree requires final-year students to undertake capstone modules which are student driven and involve independent thought, personal management of the work’s direction and are reflective of the degree's learning outcomes. Typically, these modules will have a very small taught component and staff act as mentors, rather than deliverers of information.</p>,<h3>Patterns of study</h3>,<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>,<h2>BSc (Honours) Natural Sciences </h2>,<p>With this route you could study the same three subjects each year. You could also build on your first-year studies in one or two subjects and then combine advanced modules in these subjects with a new subject(s) in your second year.</p>,<p>You could then study two or three subjects in your third year, all of which you must also have studied in earlier years. With this route you would graduate with a BSc (Hons) degree in Natural Sciences with your main subjects studied listed on the degree certificate.</p>,<p>At the end of Year 2, the BSc allows you the option of transferring onto either “with Year Abroad” or “with Placement” pathway.  Note that these options are competitive and so applicants cannot apply for these pathways through UCAS.</p>,<h2>BSc Joint Honours Degrees within Natural Sciences</h2>,<p>With a BSc Joint Honours degree in two subjects, you will study each of these two subjects in all of the three years of study. In the first year, there may be the opportunity to take modules in a third subject, if you wish. If you follow the requirements for a Joint Honours degree you graduate with a BSc Honours degree in A and B within the Natural Sciences degree (where A and B are replaced with the relevant subjects).  If a combination is not offered, it might still be possible for you to combine them with a third subject within a Natural Sciences degree that is not a Joint Honours degree. Please contact the Natural Sciences Admissions Selector for further details.  Note that the “with Year Abroad” and “with Placement” pathways are also offered as added extras with Joint Honours degrees. </p>,<h2>Year 1</h2>,<p>You must study at least two subjects, but no more than four, which give you a good progression into your second year subjects. You can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject.</p>,<h4>For instance, students who want to do the BSc Joint Honours degree in:</h4>,<ul>
<li>Biology and Earth Sciences must do four core modules, which leaves them free to choose any two optional modules from any subject on offer.</li>
<li>Economics and Mathematics must do five core modules from these subjects leaving them one free module from any subject.</li>
</ul>,<p>To find out the number of core modules for each subject you are advised to look at the <a href=""https://www.dur.ac.uk/natural.sciences/"">Natural Sciences webpages</a> as a guide.</p>,<p>BSc Natural Sciences students often take two modules from three subjects, although other combinations are possible, but this combination would normally allow progression with any or all three of these subjects. The design of the course is constrained by the entry requirements and limits of the University’s academic timetable which is published five months before the start of the academic year.</p>,<h2>Year 2</h2>,<p>You must study at least two subjects, but no more than three, which gives you reasonable progression into your third-year subjects. You can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject.</p>,<h4>For instance, students following the BSc Joint Honours degree in:</h4>,<ul>
<li>Mathematics and Physics must do five core modules leaving them free to choose another module from these subjects to achieve an equal balance.</li>
<li>Biology and Psychology must do six core modules.</li>
</ul>,<p>Students who are taking the BSc in Natural Sciences have considerable freedom which is only limited by progression and the academic timetable, so in this scenario they do not need to adhere to the strict Joint Honours rules. They must build on one or two subjects studied in their first year, but also have the option of starting a new subject by taking a first-year module in their second year.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The key characteristics of the Natural Sciences degree at Durham are choice, flexibility and depth. The Natural Sciences degree has a wide choice of subjects and in later years there is choice between modules within subjects. It is also a flexible degree and with most subjects you can delay choosing your subjects until you get to Durham and you can also change the shape of your degree at the end of the first year.</p>
<p><strong>The Natural Sciences degree has the following features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The degree is based at the Durham campus.</li>
<li>The University operates on a system of undergraduates studying 120 credits each year. There are 20, 40 and a few 60 credit modules, so students choose combinations of modules which add up to precisely 120 credits.</li>
<li>There are two types of degree that you can obtain, a 3-year BSc (degree code CFG0) or a 4-year MSci (degree code FGC0). Both the BSc and the MSci contain BSc Joint Honours and MSci Joint Honours degrees as well as the more broad BSc Natural Sciences and MSci Natural Sciences degrees.</li>
<li>You should note that not all combinations of all modules in all subjects are feasible. Choices are constrained by the limits of the University timetable, which changes every year.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the BSc Natural Sciences degree you may follow one of the following patterns of study:</p>
<ul>
<li>a BSc Natural Sciences degree in which you study two or more subjects and start a new subject in your second year or carry on with the three subjects you have studied in your first year.</li>
<li>a Joint Honours BSc degree within Natural Sciences which involves studying the same two subjects in each of the three years (it is usually possible to study three or even four subjects in the first year).</li>
<li>take a Year Abroad in between the second and third years.</li>
<li>do a placement in between the second and third years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students on the Natural Sciences course design their own programme, so depending on their choices they learn through a combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical classes, fieldwork, informal but scheduled one-on-one support, and self-directed learning, such as research, reading, and writing. All of these are supported by a virtual learning environment, Durham University Online (DUO).</p>
<p>Tutorials, seminars, workshops, and practical classes are much smaller groups than lectures, small enough to allow one-to-one interaction with a member of staff. Practicals also allow hands-on experience of the work of professionals in the disciplines studied on the course. The same is true of fieldwork and consists of engaging in, for example, geological, biological, geographical, or anthropological work in the field with members of academic staff. This emphasis on small-group and practical teaching reflects a conscious choice to enhance the quality of the learning experience rather than the quantity of formal sessions.</p>
<p>The degrees in Natural Sciences are designed to feature fewer formal sessions and more independent research as students move from their first to their final year. Small-group teaching and one-to-one attention from the personal academic advisor (provided for all students when they enter the course) are part of the learning experience throughout, but by the final year classroom time gives way, to some extent, to independent research, including a major project. In this way the degree systematically transforms the student from a consumer of knowledge in the classroom to a generator of knowledge, ready for professional or postgraduate life. These formal teaching arrangements are supported by “drop-in” surgeries with teaching staff and induction sessions that begin in the week before the start of the programme and continue at key times throughout each year of the degree. Students can also attend an extensive programme of research-focused seminars where staff and visiting scholars in various academic departments present their cutting-edge research.</p>

Through sets of specialist modules, skills-oriented classes and workshops, and dissertation research it provides the opportunity to advance your skills and knowledge in archaeology with a view to progressing either to doctoral-level research or to gaining specialist and transferable skills to develop a career in commercial archaeology or in the wider employment market.</p>,<p>The MA Archaeology is designed to take advantage of the exceptionally wide research interests of the staff in Durham Archaeology, which range from the Palaeolithic of western Europe, through Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age Europe, to the Classical archaeology of the Greek and Roman worlds, through Egyptology, the archaeology of the ancient and Islamic Near East and Arabia, to Buddhism in South Asia and trade in the Indian Ocean, and the archaeology of the medieval, post-medieval and historic periods. <br> <br> From this wide spread students are able to select a combination of specialist taught courses and a dissertation topic in precisely in the areas that interest them. At the same time they will form part of a large cohort of students taking this and associated courses creating a student community amongst whom  some courses in research, presentation and practical skills are shared, along with discussions and events. This structure offers the opportunity for interdisciplinary exchange combined with specialist training in key archaeological skills and knowledge, as well as making friendships and contacts from around the world.</p>,<p>By the end of this course you will have gained detailed specialist knowledge related to your periods/areas of study from our team of leading experts; you will also have developed your skills and experience in areas such as the collection, management and analysis of archaeological data and materials; current archaeological approaches, methods, and practice; the presentation of archaeological research; and a range of practical skills.</p>","<div id=""learning"" class=""tab-pane"">
    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The MA is delivered through a mixture of lectures, seminars, workshops and practical classes. Typically lectures provide key information on a particular area and identify the main areas for discussion and debate among archaeologists on a particular theme. Seminars then provide opportunities for smaller groups to discuss and debate particular issues or areas, based on the knowledge gained through lectures and through reading. Practical classes and workshops allow you to gain direct experience of practical and interpretative skills in archaeology. Finally, independent supervised study enables you to develop and undertake a research project to an advanced level with the dissertation. Throughout the course emphasis is placed on working independently and developing critical and analytical skills to an advanced level.</p>
<p>The balance of activities changes throughout the course as you develop your knowledge and abilities as researchers, in order to prepare for work or advanced study once having completed the course. In the first two terms you will attend around four hours of lectures, workshops or practical classes, and two one-hour seminars per week. Practical work complements desk-based analytical skills, and is intended to develop skills applicable within and outside the field of archaeology. Outside timetabled contact hours, you are also expected to undertake your own independent study to prepare effectively for your classes,  enhance your subject knowledge and develop a research agenda. During these first two terms, you have the opportunity to do one or two formative (non-assessed) essays or presentations in preparation for summative (assessed) work. Typically you will submit around three or four pieces of summative work per term, consisting of essays (c. 2,000 or 3,000 words) or practical projects such as posters.</p>
<p>Over term 2 and into term 3 the balance shifts as you develop your abilities as an independent researcher. The lectures and workshops will introduce you to archaeological research methods in specific fields of study and allow you to practice them. You will also engage with academic issues, archaeological datasets and their interpretation. The dissertation is regarded as the capstone of the MA and as an indicator of advanced research potential, which could be developed further in a professional or academic field. Under the close supervision of a specialist member of academic staff you will undertake independent, detailed study of a particular theme, area or research problem, and produce a substantial piece of academic written work of around 20,000 words.</p>
<p>Throughout the course you will also have access to an academic adviser, who will provide you with academic support and guidance. In addition, all members of teaching staff have weekly office hours when they are available to meet on a ‘drop-in’ basis. The department also has a vibrant programme of <a href=""https://www.dur.ac.uk/archaeology/whatson/"">research seminars</a> and <a href=""https://www.dur.ac.uk/archaeology/research/research_groups/"">research and impact group</a> activities, which you are strongly encouraged to attend.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>At the beginning of the academic year, you will go through five-day induction events in which you are informed about University, the School, the MA/MSc degrees and the facilities available for their learning.</p>
<p>The 180 credits one-year MA degree is divided into two core and two optional modules of 30 credits each. Furthermore, you will have to submit a dissertation of 60 credits of not more than 12,000 words. Most of the modules are delivered during the first two terms and you will spend the remaining time writing your dissertation.</p>
<p>PGT modules involve a range of different modes of delivery, but are largely based around lectures, seminars and other forms of active learning activities. The School places great importance on research-led teaching, which integrates new and cutting-edge research into the curriculum. Each module is build around 300 hours of learning, a large portion of which is independent reading and preparation. Class contact hours are all above 20 hours per module, with the exception of the dissertation, and are spread across the 12 teaching weeks in the academic calendar.  Typically modules would have elements of lectures, discussions, and presentations or other activities — the extent of each of these components would differ from one module to another.</p>
<p>All modules include a formative assessment to help you prepare for summative assignments by allowing you to identify what aspects of your work you are doing well on and which areas require improvement. You are encouraged to make appointments with the course lecturers to discuss module content, and after you have received it, any feedback on your work.</p>
<p>Typically summative assessments are around 3000 words, but these vary based on learning outcomes, assessment type, and module design. Some modules may be assessed by examination. The majority of coursework involves independent reading and written assignments, but you will have the opportunity to discuss course material as well either through presentations or class discussions.  You will be assigned a dissertation supervisor, who will also act as your academic advisor, and is someone you can consult throughout the year for general academic support, in addition to dissertation supervision.</p>
<p>SGIA conducts regular seminars and organises lectures throughout the year which all postgraduate students can attend. These events provide opportunities to engage with, and debate, the most important issues in current political and international studies.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the programme you can contact the Careers Office of the University to get advice on available job prospects and get assistance on applying for these.</p>

The balance will depend on the particular module, with some more suited to a lecture/seminar approach, others being of a more practical nature.</p>
<p>The focus throughout the courses is on independent learning and student engagement, you are expected to participate in presentations, micro-teaching and the like. The average weekly number of contact hours over the first two terms is 12, you will fill the remaining time with reading, class preparation and assignments.</p>
<p>In addition, starting in the first term, you will attend a series of dissertation sessions (typically 2 hours per fortnight) culminating in a poster conference in the third term. You are assigned a dissertation supervisor, and can expect three or four meetings during the third term and the summer.</p>

    <h2 class=""section"">Course Learning and Teaching</h2><p>The course is delivered through an exciting and challenging mixture of lectures, seminars, tutorials, workshops, practical classes, and a supervised dissertation. Lectures provide students with key information on a particular topic in bioarchaeology, and identify the main areas for discussion and debate. Seminars and tutorials provide opportunities for smaller groups of students to discuss and debate particular issues, based on the knowledge gained through lectures and independent study outside the programme’s formal contact hours. Practical classes and workshops allow students to gain direct experience of and acquire essential practical skills in the recording, analysis, and interpretation of bioarchaeological data, with guidance from experienced, world-leading scientists. Finally, through supervised projects and dissertations,  students have the opportunity to put their knowledge and skills into practice, and to design and execute a substantial piece of independent, original research.</p>
<p>Throughout the degree emphasis is placed on working independently outside the formal contact hours, reading widely, exploring and synthesising large datasets, and to developing critical and analytical skills to an advanced level. The degree assessed through a variety of essays, reports, and skills-based exercises, culminating in the written dissertation based on original research.</p>
<p>Throughout the course students also have access to an academic advisor, usually the leader of their selected degree pathway, who provides them with academic support and guidance. All members of teaching staff have weekly office hours when they are available to meet with students on a ‘drop-in’ basis, but the Department’s teaching staff are renowned for being friendly, approachable, and helpful should you have queries at any time. The department and its Bioarchaeology Research Group are a vibrant research community, offering an exciting programme of Departmental, Bioarchaeology, and Postgraduate Research seminars that students are strongly encouraged to attend.</p>
